Isotretinoin is a wonderful drug. The usual course of 20 mg a day lasts for around six months for an average weighed female.
Different doctors do it differently. I prefer not to stop it abruptly but taper it gradually over a period of a month or two to decrease the chance of recurrence.
However, that does not always mean your acne will not come back. It will just not be of as dangerous as earlier and can be controlled by topical creams.
Stop Isotretinoin three months before planning a pregnancy.

CMIA (chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay) also know as HIV-DUO test. It checks for two things, both antigen and antibody. So, this test is highly conclusive after six weeks, and at six months, it is very conclusive.
Seroconversion means developing antibody against the virus. HIV-DUO detect antibody, but it also recognizes antigen as I said. So, CMIA will come positive even if antibodies has not yet developed.
Antibody may take time to develop (means seroconversion) in those with weak health or having cancer or taking chemotherapeutic drugs. These people are not able to produce antibody early, so it is not detected.
But, they get antigen when they are infected, and HIV-DUO or CMIA test can detect it. So, this test is highly conclusive.

Your history, clinical description and histopathology (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are most likely suggestive of urticaria.
Urticaria is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction of the skin to various common triggers such as insect bites, infective focus elsewhere in the body, changes in the environment, certain painkillers, some foods such as seafood, peanuts and mushrooms, thyroid disorders, etc.
Although immediate, the effect of each episode tends to last up to four weeks; wherein there will be a delayed release of inflammatory mediators, putting you at further risk for a new episode.
I would advise you to try and find out the possible triggering factor for the attacks, which usually lies in the activities and exposures of the previous one hour before the episode.
You could ask your doctor to help you to find out the risk factors and regarding your term of medication.
You could also take a note of the emergency measures need in case you tend to have a severe episode with swelling of lips and face.
Rare eosinophils in your biopsy suggest that there are only a few occasional allergic white blood cells in the field.
The overall impression is that you are having an episode of urticaria, which very well responds to antihistamines such as Cetirizine and Fexofenadine. However, they need to be taken for a duration of two to four weeks at least.
It is a very common skin problem and can be managed comprehensively. Your biopsy confirms the same too.

Then apply the gel and rub it in gently and do not wash the face after using.

Rosacea is a condition which may get aggravates during season change, temperature change, exercise, alcohol and stress. In rosacea, skin becomes very sensitive, and you cannot apply for any other medicines.
As you said treatment prescribed by the previous doctor worked for you, you can continue those medicines.
We use Salicylic acid (20% to 30%) or Azelaic acid peels. Rosacea makes skin very sensitive so we defer using peels at home as peels contain acid which may also harm if not applied under supervision. Patient friendly peels are not easily available.
You can go to your local dermatologist and ask for these peels. Meanwhile, I suggest you topical Salicylic acid 2% gel or Azelaic acid 20% gel.

During an episode of the flu, the rash is a very common manifestation. However, at times, it is very tough to differentiate if it is a viral rash or a drug rash because of allergy to the medication.
Viral exanthems do follow a pattern in a few cases, and they subside on their own as the body recovers from the illness.
Drug rashes usually take a longer time, as it takes more than three times the half-life of the drug, for it to be eliminated from the body.
As in your case too, the rash could have a possibility of both, either a viral exanthem or drug rash.
As it is not severe enough for an admission, the best treatment option would be the use of antihistamines in appropriate dose covering a period of at least 10 to 14 days.
Over a period of one to two weeks, you should be able to recover completely from this issue.
Antihistamines are very safe, except for a little bit of drowsiness and can be taken without any fear. If needed, the dose can be increased up to four times the standard dose.
I would advise you to continue Allegra (Fexofenadine) if in case the rash still appears while on medication you may consider increasing the dose to 180 mg once daily.
You can continue Hydrocort cream (Hydrocortisone). It is not advisable to take oral steroids so early in the course.
Investigations to be done:Complete blood picture and absolute eosinophil count to check for eosinophilia, which is a manifestation in drug rashes.Regarding follow up:Revert with the reports to a dermatologist online.--->

It is basically frictional dermatitis, which has left behind pigmentation.
Do not use Fusiwal-M cream (Mometasone furoate and Fusidic acid) as there is no inflammation. It will take time for pigmentation to resolve.
I suggest Kojiglo gel (Kojic acid and vitamin C) or Melaglow Rich cream (Avobenzone) twice daily for two months on black spots.
With any topical application, there will be improvement till certain extent only. For better results, later you can consider spot peel or laser treatment from your dermatologist.

It is one of the proposed theories that Pityriasis rosea could be an exanthema secondary to HHV 6 and 7 (human herpes virus) virus infection.
Most of the data available regarding PR in pregnancy is about the first trimester of pregnancy wherein HHV 6 and7 infections are known to increase the rates of miscarriages as they mimic CMV infection (cytomegalovirus).
However, the fetal organ production ends by the 18th week and any infection beyond this period does not lead to any serious effect on it.
HHV infections beyond this time may affect the birth weight of the baby to some extent, but would not result in any significant complications.
Moreover, the proposed rates of transmission to the fetus from the mother are very very low, putting you at almost negligible risk. You can rest your fears.

I have read your query.
Yes, acne is caused by a bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes, but beside this other factors also play in forming acne.
Change in keratinization pattern in pilosebaceous unit, which leads to a keratinous material to cause blocking of sebum secretion leads to comedone formation.
These comedones plugging and complex interaction between androgens and bacteria in the plugged pilosebaceous units leads to inflammation. This is the reason for using antibiotics for the management of acne along with medicine like retinoids (Adapalene or Isotretinoin) for maintaining keratinization.

Almost 90% of the people experience acne during their age from 15 to 30 years. It is because of the hormonal fluctuations of adolescence. However, the grade and severity differ according to the skin type and tendency.

In people with heavy sweating activities, diabetes, overweight, those wearing tight clothing and in people with prolonged sitting activities the body folds are the sites for the collection of sweat. As a consequence, the skin in these places gets macerated and acts a good base for fungal growth.
The problem will keep on recurring if not taken care of the above risk factors.

Penile pearly papule is just a normal variant. It is not a disease, so no treatment is required for it. But, you got it removed by CO2 laser.
Penis skin is very sensitive area and CO2 laser always gives redness of skin. Not only penile area, but even in the normal skin redness comes and persists for four to six months.
In your condition, the best way of treatment is just wait and let the skin heal from inside.
Canesten cream (Clotrimazole) is an antifungal and it will not use here.
Travocort (Isoconazole and Diflucortolone) has steroid, which you have used 10 days. But, it is a very mild steroid, so it may not subside redness.
I suggest you Flutivate cream (Fluticasone) for 10 days over the red skin. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
Avoid friction and use lubricant. Just wait for a month and the problem will subside itself. Actually, intense treatment is not required in your condition.

One's  skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed.
Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it.
The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of skin color while attempting lightening procedures.
I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM.
Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

Although photo of the lesion is not very clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity), as per your description of problem it is looking like molluscum contagiosum. It gets spread by contact, either sexual or nonsexual.
It is painless, small, pearl-like solid and non-itchy lesions (same as yours). If you look closely, there will be a pinpoint depression in every lesion.
For treatment, it can be removed by needle or electrocautery for that you have to go to a local dermatologist. It is a very simple procedure and require approximately 20 minutes.
Because, it is a STD (sexually transmitted disease). We should rule out the history of unprotective sexual contact.

Your clinical image (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is confirmative for a verruca plana, which is a plane viral wart.
All warts are caused by human papilloma virus (HPV); however the strains causing it are different. On the face, it is usually due to HPV 3 and 10.
The vaccines available for HPV are mainly to cover for genital warts caused by HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33. These vaccines do not protect you against the normal skin warts as they are caused by totally different strains of HPV.
Taking a vaccine can only protect you against the four strains causing warts on your genitalia.

How many days does your period date shift from the expected date? Do you get any hair growth in facial areas like upper lips or chin?
Although your weight is correct for your height, PCOS can be present in thin individuals as well. We can start the treatment for acne depending on your hormonal profile results.
Fillers are of different types depending on the area to be treated such as tear trough (under eyes), lips, cheeks, etc.

Isotretinoin has no effect on facial hair. An increase in the facial hair can be attributed to either hormonal  abnormality or topical steroid abuse.
Isotretinoin must be continued in tapering doses for at least six months.
You need to go for a hormonal evaluation by ultrasound abdomen in order to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), which is a common source of ectopic hormone.
You also need to undergo serum testosterone, FSH and LH ratio (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) and serum DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone).

I have seen your query and concern.
Over the neck, it seems that you have Poikiloderma of Civatte (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Poikiloderma of Civatte refers to redness associated with a mottled pigmentation seen on the sides of the neck, more common in women.
The cause is mainly chronic sun exposure. Prevention is to avoid sun exposure and to use sunscreens, avoid perfumes and cosmetics.
There is no specific medical treatment exists for poikiloderma of Civatte. Avoiding sun exposure and proper use of sunscreen are most important.
About sores or scab looks like lichen simplex chronicus. I suggest you HHSALIC ointment (Mometasone and Salicylic acid) twice daily for five days after consulting your GP.
I can make out a few acrochordons over your neck. For them, the treatment is radiofrequency cautery.

As per experience only two skin diseases looks like this. The first one is of course melanoma and the second is seborrheic keratosis.
The main signs and symptoms of melanoma are as follows:
With time the size will get increased.
Color also changes with time.
Margin of lesion also change from round to irregular.
As the melanoma goes deep bleeding also increases.
Singe lesion most of the time.
It is true that white people are more prone to get melanoma, but your site of lesion is not common. In this age melanoma or other skin cancer comes over more photo exposed part of the body like face or hand.
Now, let me explain the signs and symptoms of seborrheic keratosis.
More common over scalp and in older age group.
Does not bleed and little raised (not flat) on skin. 
Often found multiple in number.
Not itchy and no specific symptom.
Now, I personally feel your problem goes more towards melanoma or BCC (basal cell carcinoma). You need to go for biopsy. Biopsy would be an ultimate tool to diagnose the disease.

After carefully reading your history I came to a conclusion that there are two possibilities of your rash.
Drug reaction:
It can mimic like anything and can remain up to 3 to 5 months and then subside as the drug gets cleared from the body.
Photoallergic dermatitis:
The symptoms which you have mentioned, that it is aggravated in presence of sunlight is going in favour of photodermatitis.
Its persisting nature is going in favour of it.
The presence of rash in sun exposed area is going in favour of it.
Since you have not mentioned the other areas affected, I can just make an assumption of it being not present in relatively sun protected area like buttocks and abdomen.
The burning nature is also going in favour of it as normal allergic reactions usually itch and do not burn.
I would advise you take Prednisolone 40 mg in tapering doses and sunscreen with at least 50 spf, thrice daily at 8 AM,11 AM AND 2 PM,  with 2.5 finger tip unit (one finger tip unit is the amount of ointment expelled from a tube with a nozzle of 5 mm diameter, from the skin crease that is closest to the end of the finger, to the tip of the index finger) for at least face.

This is called xanthelasma, a deposition of cholesterol and fat around the eyes.
It is a painless condition and takes time to develop. It is a gradual fat deposition and xanthelasma will increase in size.
It is a very common problem and mostly found in people who have more fat with a habit of eating more junk food and soft drinks.
First, check your blood cholesterol level and lipid profile. Many times the level will be high, but it could be normal also. If it is high, then follow the diet restriction.
TCA application (Trichloroacetic acid) is one of the most common and simplified treatment options. We apply this on the spots. It burns the cholesterol and in a few days the burnt area will fall off. The remaining skin will heal without any scar. Two to three sittings are required for this treatment.
Laser removal is an another option and requires well-equipped CO2 laser setup. This process needs to be done under local anesthesia. The laser will directly burn the xanthelasma. This procedure may cause mild swelling around eyes for the next two to three days of treatment.

These are corns. These are painful on pressure.
They are best dealt with radiocautery, which is a simple office based surgery with cautery machine or by  laser.
It is a  superficial procedure which would be performed by your dermatologist and only local anesthesia is required.
Wear soft footwear as they are formed due to local pressure.
Salicylic and lactic acid based lotion may be used topically. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
You can apply it in a small amount every night, but it is not as effective as the surgical option.

Blotchy pigmentation is a common problem noticed in patients above 50 years of age. A sensitive skin predisposes more to such pigmentary changes.
Your clinical images are suggestive of macular seborrheic keratosis or solar lentigo, both of which are benign.
Although, commonly seen in chronically sun exposed sites, they do tend to occur elsewhere as a part of dermatoheliosis (chronological photoaging of the skin).
As your skin has had repeated rashes and breakouts in view of its higher sensitivity, it would be preferable not to apply occlusive cosmetics and lotions as they may further increase the risk of such pigmentary lesions.
You could instead use a sunscreen with SPF of more than 30 (sun protection factor) and a good moisturizer to prevent further such lesions.
You can be assured that the lesions have no features suggestive of any skin malignancy.
Differential diagnosis:1. Macular seborrheic keratosis.

2. Solar lentigo.

3. Elastosis secondary to aging.

4. Stellate pseudoscars and pigmentation of agingTreatment plan:Sunscreen with SPF greater than 30 in the morning and good moisturizing lotion at evenings.Preventive measures:1. Avoid occlusive cosmetics.

Post radiation therapy, the skin does suffer a burnt both immediate as well as on a long term.
Dryness, itching leading to oozing and crusting are very common complaints after radiotherapy and can start as late as 15 to 20 years too after the treatment.
Radiation therapy does not increase the risk of melanoma. There are chances for basal cell carcinoma, which is much easier to treat and not life threatening.
Squamous cell cancer also can occur, however, simple eczema needs to be ruled out even before thinking of the same.
A negative biopsy is quite sensitive if chosen from the appropriate site.
I would advise not to panic for the fear of a melanoma and instead keep up with close follow up to note the course of the problem.
Differential diagnosis:1. Nipple eczema, post radiation.

Growth of facial hair is not a side effect of Isotretinoin. It could be due to factors such as racial, hormonal and irregular menses.

The quality of your pictures was unfortunately not very good, but decent enough to allow me to make a provisional diagnosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
It seems that you are suffering from a form of contact allergic eczema. It is an eczema in response to an allergy to some agricultural substance or vegetation product or chemical such as a pesticide or fertilizer or some other occupational exposure substance.
It is also possible that you may have an intrinsic tendency of allergies in general and reacting to these purported substances, in an out of proportion way due to that tendency.
I suggest applying a potent corticosteroid cream, preferably with an antifungal combination, such as Tenovate-M (Clobetasol propionate) cream or a plain potent steroid cream or ointment such as Halox or Halovate (Halobetasol propionate) ointment to be applied twice a day over the affected areas for a duration of 15 days.
Additionally, I suggest tablet Allegra (Fexofenadine) 180 mg one tablet to be taken daily in the evening around 6 to 7 PM for 10 days. Try to visit a general practitioner or a family physician and take the above treatment with consent.
Use only a mild soap, such as a baby soap or creamy soap for washing hands. Strictly avoid exposure to any detergents, medicated soaps, harsh soaps and hand sanitizer, as they may worsen the condition.
This should provide you with instant relief from your current problem. However, after your examinations are over and the condition subsides, you shall need to consult a dermatologist in person. So, that further tests such as a patch test may be conducted to elucidate a suspected cause of this contact allergy.

Actually, it is a fungal infection only. Remaining mole like skin is nothing but, unaffected patches.
Penile area does not get involved in fungal infection, but sometimes it happens.
I would suggest you not get panicked and apply an antifungal cream same as you are using.
Wait for two to three weeks to resolve and your skin will acquire original color.
Continue the same antifungal  treatment and stop Clindamycin and Benzoyl peroxide creams. Just use antifungal creams on the skin.

Although the pictures are not clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can perceive it as the junctional nevus.
Using vinegar cause irritant reaction and thus causing the destruction  of melanocytes, but unfortunately this method is not precise and does not cause the removal of all the melanocytes and thus should not be practiced.
In your case there is nothing, what we would say as malignant. Regarding erythema, it is also known as post-inflammatory erythema and will subside with time,  nevertheless you can use NMFE lotion (moisturizer) twice daily for better healing.
Regarding blood streaming of malignant cells,  I would like to say that first it would manifest over the skin and then it would metastasize into the blood. So, it is not a concern in your case.

You have developed irritant contact dermatitis to baking soda.
You should wash your face with plain water only and avoid using soap till the reaction gets over. Besides this, apply Eumosone cream (Clobetasol propionate) on the affected areas twice daily.
Also, use a good quality moisturizing cream like on your entire face frequently and liberally like three to four times in a day.
For sunburn, use a high SPF (sun protection factor) sunscreen gel on your entire face at intervals of three to four hours during the daytime and apply Mometasone cream on the areas having sunburn twice daily.
Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Continue the treatment for 10 days.

But, in patients who are diabetic, old age, secondarily infected and with an incomplete antiviral dose or seropositive it can take up to 15 days to get cured.
In elderly age group even after the skin lesions heal the patient might experience intense pain in that particular area. It is called as postherpetic neuralgia.

Milia are a white material containing papule type lesions that mainly presents over the face.
Milia are due to sun exposure. Long term sunlight exposure cause sweating and mild sunlight reaction and in turn form milia. If you notice the area, then you will come to know it is always present over sun exposed part only like face, hand, neck and forehead.
For further prevention, use proper sunscreen with 50 SPF (sun protection factor).
Sunscreen should be applied in daylight before going outside twice or thrice in a day.
I want to make you sure that after removal of milia no marks will be left. I do it on a daily basis and almost every day. It should be extracted by small needle and it is not a time taking, painful or complicated procedure.
Milia is very superficial lesion so even if it is removed manually by needle or extractor they do not leave any scar or marks. So, you can go for it without any anxiety or anxiousness. It is completely a very superficial procedure.
To make you more comfortable, I would like to tell you that scar always comes when something happening deep to the skin like any injury or severe acne. But, milia are so superficial.

Avoid direct contact of woolen on your skin and wear cotton clothing underneath.
Avoid perfumes, pets, heavy curtains and carpets, which gather dust.

Your dermatologist prescribed Methotrexate and it is a test  dose given to you. Subsequently, if needed the dose of Methotrexate will be increased depending on your response. You have started on the right treatment.
Along with oral the topical medications given to you will help. Also, narrow band UVB therapy (ultraviolet B) called as phototherapy works well in case of psoriasis.
If your doctor has this facility, then ask him when you visit next time. Because, it will take time to resolve only with medication.

Do not take Septra for acne (combination of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim).
Isotretinoin is not safe if you are planning a pregnancy. Otherwise, there is no risk.
There are alternatives available like Minocycline and Doxycycline. I suggest a capsule Doxy 100 mg twice daily and antacid along with it.
Minocycline, if planning to take for acne, then should be taken at night (capsule Minonil ER 45) as it leads to photosensitivity.
You should take one capsule and see if there is any change in pigmentation on face like darkening. If not, then continue.
In your case, fractional laser as advised would better since you have box and roller scar and peels for pigmentation.

It is a method to remove wart by an instrument. For that you need to go to local dermatologist. It is a very simple and quick procedure.
If you are not able to go to a doctor, then you can use Podowart-S solution (Podophyllotoxin) on the wart. But, it is not much effective and the wart comes back again and again.

I understand your concern.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a type of urticaria (wheals). It is a disturbing illness and difficult to manage.
Most urticaria patients benefit from prolonged antihistamines and some may require immune suppressing drugs like Cyclosporine to control urticaria, which were also given to you.
When the relief is not satisfactory from all these options, the physicians opt for a biologic medicine called Omalizumab. This medicine prevents the release of urticaria causing molecules in your body.
It is considered safe and has proven efficacy in appropriate subjects.  It will be given under a physician's supervision and side effects will be monitored.
It has helped many patients to attain a longer symptom free periods. You can go ahead comfortably with the treatment.

Is the hair lost from the temple and vertex of the scalp? Is it diffuse hair fall?

Take a nutritious and protein rich diet, such as pulses, milk products and eggs.
Avoid routine application of gels or frequent blow drying of your hair. Use a sulfate free shampoo for your hair twice a week.

With your descriptions, it seems that you are having a mole with secondary infections. If you can send pictures of this, then it will be better for me to suggest diagnosis, treatment and alleviate your anxiety.
Mole, so called melanocytic nevus, if you frequently touch your mole it may get infected.
They are considered benign melanomas and nothing actively needs to be done for them.
If the mole shows sudden changes, such as increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc., then you may go for a skin biopsy.
But, in your case, it initially requires oral antibiotics like tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days and topical cream Fusidic acid local application twice daily for five days. Once infection gets controlled, then you can go for removal.
For removal, you may choose any one of the treatment options. Shave excision under local anesthesia by a dermatologist, TCA (trichloroacetic acid) cautery, radiofrequency cautery or laser treatment.
The Probable causes:Frequent touch of mole with finger.Investigations to be done:Mole excision biopsy to rule out any malignant changes.Differential diagnosis:1. Infected melanocytic nevus.

Yes, we need to trim the full hair and it takes at least six months to get results. So, it is a long process. You will be required  3000-3500 graft to fill the front and crown part of the scalp. You have to decide yourself the suitable time to get a hair transplant.
Stopping hair fall is a difficult one. In androgenic alopecia, medicine will show temporary work up and nothing can stop your hair fall completely.
I suggest you the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
Minoxidil hair oil (5%) in the night over scalp with 10 minute massage.
Follihair one tablet every day.
You can get PRP sitting in clinics (platelet-rich plasma). It is the most advance procedure non-surgical). It needs multiple sessions with a gap of two weeks between two sessions.
Other than this dermaroller is an another option you can get with PRP. This too the same as PRP needs a multiple session. You can take dermaroller and PRP together to increase the effect.
But, all these methods cannot stop the hair fall completely. Also, it depends on your scalp nature that how much baldness you will get. It may stop after a few years or it may go till many years to make completely bald.

At times in females the lesions go unnoticed.
No, there is no need to check for molluscum. But, you get tested for HIV because recurrent genital molluscum contagiosum and HIV are associated.
Avoid sexual contact until and unless all your lesions are treated and there is no single active skin lesion. Else, there are high chances of your partner to suffer from the same.
Needling and curettage of molluscum is the best line of management. Molluscum bodies should be removed or killed. Liquid nitrogen is better in case of genital lesions.
Yes, get your STD profile done (sexually transmitted disease).

Studies have shown that there is no risk to the mother or fetus if the partner is on Finasteride 1 mg daily while conceiving and thereafter.
However, females should avoid handling these tablets during pregnancy just as a precautionary measure.
You can continue consuming Finasteride for your alopecia and can plan your family.

Yes, your treatment is right. But, do not take Folitrax for long duration (Methotrexate) as it can adversely affect your liver and immunity.
Also, if it is limited to palm and soles, then there is no need to take it. Because, Folitrax is meant for use in severe psoriasis, which is not responding to other medications.
This is an incurable condition, so we can only control the outbreak and prevent it. You need to take medication as less as necessary.

It is a case of friction blister with superimposed fungal infection especially candidal.
Sweating and friction lead to maceration, which is responsible for this disease.
Instead of Calamine, I suggest Clotrimazole powder two to three times daily. It will not only acts against the fungus, but also reduce the friction. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
Keep the area dry after activity by wiping it with a clean towel and apply powder before and during active days in order to reduce friction. Nothing much you can do except to avoid the activity.

This looks like acute urticaria.
If the skin colored hives and wheals appear and disappear for a few days, then it is called acute urticaria. If the symptoms persist for more than six weeks, then it is called chronic urticaria.
If these skin colored bumps pain on vertical pressure, then it is called as urticarial vasculitis.
Urticaria is due to allergy to various things. Is there any history of recent fever, burning micturition, medication intake and intake of fish or nuts?
Allergy test is available to find out as to what you may have developed an allergy.
I suggest you antihistamine daily for 10-15 days. Also, I suggest tablet Levocetirizine 10 mg twice a day, tablet Ranitidine 150 mg twice a day before meal.
Apply calamine lotion or Venusia soft lotion on the body. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
If there is swelling of the lips or eyes or any difficulty in swallowing, then visit an emergency room immediately.

Yes, you need to consult a dermatologist as the features are suggestive of malignancy. The final diagnosis could only be made on histopathological examination, which is considered as a gold standard.
Many times, benign lesion also has the appearance of malignancy. But, if on histopathological examination no malignancy gets detected, then there is no need to get panic.
Excisional biopsy is not only diagnostic, but therapeutic too.

Intermittent active phases manifesting with burning, scaling and itching and alternating with inactive periods. The activity is increased in winter and early spring with remissions commonly occur in summer.

I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. I have also viewed the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
These are ice pick and boxcar scars (the big ones) of acne.
Treatment for the small ice pick (hole-like) scars may be  started with 50% to 100% TCA CROSS (Trichloroacetic acid), which involves application of a chemical to these scars by your dermatologist.
This method is relatively cheaper, but there is a downtime of about two to four weeks with this method as post procedure spots will be visible.
Fractional CO2 laser will also  give wonderful results for your type of scars.
Dermabrasion can also be done, but not much in use now. Chemical peels will not work for this type of scars.
Retino-A will not be much effective. At the most, you will be able to see 5-10%  improvement over small ice pick scars with Retino-A (Tretinoin).

Due to prolonged use of the creams, the original picture has been altered (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and a clear-cut diagnosis is difficult to establish.
Going by the area and some other signs in all likelihood it seems a case of fungal infection. As you have taken medicines for so long and it is likely that resistance to the medicines has occurred. So, will have to prescribe you a different set of medicines.
Do exactly as told and you will find relief and benefit. Since a close up examination of the skin is not possible, going by the picture and data submitted by you, it seems a tinea cruris infection.
Do not apply or rub soap. The skin is burnt and will not heal if you do so. Use a fresh, washed and cleaned underwear every day, preferably cotton and comfortable fit.
Dry the area first completely before putting on clothes. Place the towel in boiling salt water and dry it in the sun. Do this every four days to kill fungus.
Get fasting, post meal blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels tested. If there is a high sugar, then get it corrected as soon as possible. Only then will the skin treatment will be effective.
Restrict your intake of milk, cheese, yeast and bread during the course of the treatment.
Exercise regularly and lose some weight. It will help in the treatment.

It is primarily an autoimmune disease with a familial predisposition presented with chalky white or milky white in appearance.
Other autoimmune diseases may be associated like pernicious anemia, diabetes, alopecia areata (patchy hair loss) and thyroid disorder. So, you need to do blood sugar, T3, T4 and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone).
I suggest ointment Tacrolimus 0.1% during night hours and Mometasone 0.1% cream in the daytime for six months or may be more depending on your response to the treatment.

With your descriptions and given picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that you are having a mole over axilla.
This site is more prone for frictions due to clothing and because of this your mole so called melanocytic nevus.
They are considered benign melanomas and nothing actively needs to be done for them.
If the mole shows a sudden increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc., then you may go for a skin biopsy.
If you want to get it removed for purely cosmetic reasons, then you may choose  any of the one. Shave excision under local anesthesia by dermatologist, TCA (trichloroacetic acid) cautery, radiofrequency cautery or laser treatment.

The dull skin is due to Isotretinoin.
It takes away the moisturizing sebum and oil from the skin, by which it acts in acne. The same action causes the side effect of dry and itchy skin.
First, you should understand that this effect is temporary and will improve with time. It may take 2 to 4 months at the most.
Avoid using soap on your skin. Use a medicated soapless cleansing lotion instead like Cetaphil cleansing lotion. Do not scrub or bleach this area.
Use a good emollient moisturizer like Aveeno moisturizing lotion for your skin, but avoid on the face. Apply non-comedogenic sunscreen on the face.
Also, I suggest supplements containing vitamins C and E such as capsule Cute-E.

The growth is a viral wart. It is a form of superficial viral growth on the skin.
Yes, it usually increases in size if left untreated and can spread to other body parts by direct contact.
They are best dealt with radiocautery, which is a simple office based surgery done with a cautery machine. It is a five minute superficial procedure, which would be performed by your dermatologist. Only local anesthesia is required.
Do not touch the wart repeatedly as they may spread to other body parts.

Vitiligo can be inherited in the family, but not in every member of the generation.
It is not necessary for vitiligo to develop in childhood; the onset can be at any stage of life.
Inheritance was thought to be autosomal dominant with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. It means the next generation may or may not have vitiligo. There is fair chance that the next generation may not have it and can skip generations.
Vitiligo is not predictable. So, there are equal chances.

You need to understand the basic pathology about herpes.
You had herpes genitalis in the past and there are chances of you having recurrent episode if your immunity is low.
As your partner also has it, you both need to take antiviral therapy. The most important line of management is Acyclovir.
In case of recurrent herpes genitalis, patients are put on suppressive therapy with Acyclovir even for six months so that they do not face similar problems again.
When you have a fresh episode of herpes, there are chances of you transmitting this to your partner in the first year. You need to have protected intercourse.
Usually, herpes labialis does not require treatment, but when the patient has recurrent episodes then antiviral therapy is given.
Since you are having recurrent herpes labialis, you should consider taking antiviral therapy again. Remember, whenever there are new episode, then the chance of transmitting herpes to partner is high.
The dose of L-Lysine monohydrochloride tablets (1000 mg L-Lysine per dose) is two times a day. It can be taken till six months.

As you explained that your mother has developed solar urticaria. Here I explain a few other importance of solar urticaria.
Intense itching, swelling and rashes develop in sunlight. You can correlate it. Whenever she goes in the sun, she gets these things.
If you are able notice this then undoubtedly it is something related to the sun. Many times only itching is the main symptom which your mother has.
Now, once it has started, avoiding the cause is the best way to treat. Once you are sure that it is happening due to sun just avoid going out in the sun.
Photo test is not a treatment. It is a test to know that your mother has a sunlight allergy or not and it can get noticed by symptoms. So, no need to get tested if you already sure about the cause.
Regarding treatment, sunscreen is must. Use sunscreen without fail. It does not matter whether you are going in sunlight or not. You have to use it. It should be thrice in a day. It could be like 9 AM, 12 PM and 3 PM.
Anti-allergic tablets like Levocetirizine, Avil (Pheniramine maleate), Teczine, etc. Continue it for three to five months. These have totally no side effect and subside the allergy and itching. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

It seems that you are suffering from paronychia with ingrown nails. Paronychia is infection around a fingernail.
In your case, since you are suffering from last 6 years, it looks like chronic paronychia, which is usually caused by a fungal infection.
It can get investigated either through gram staining or culture to rule out bacteria or Potassium hydroxide smear to rule out fungal infection.
In case of soft tissue swelling, the infection may resolve with warm soaks of three to four times daily. But, if an abscess has developed, then incision and drainage must be performed.
For pain, I suggest oral antibiotics like Augmentin 625 mg thrice daily (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) if not sensitive to penicillin group.
Also, I suggest a topical Fusidic acid cream and Clotrimazole or Sebifine ointment (Terbinafine) twice daily for five days.
For nail plate abnormality, I suggest tablet Fluconazole once weekly for six months. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

I would suggest the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
Tablet Terbinafine 250 mg to be taken once daily for three weeks.
Sertaconazole cream 2% applied locally twice on the inner thighs and the base of the scrotum.
Tablet Loratadine 10 mg to be taken once or twice daily depending on the severity of the itching.
Along with this, apply Calamine lotion once or twice a day to prevent friction between skin folds and also wear pure cotton underclothes to avoid sweating and irritation.
The outgrowths of skin are skin tags and they are usually related to hyperlipidemia. They are not harmful and  only have cosmetic concerns.
They are best dealt with by simple office based surgery with cautery machine requiring only local anesthesia, which is a 5 minute superficial procedure. But, they will not go on their own.
You may get your fasting serum lipid profile done, which will measure the levels of cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein).
If any of these are abnormal suitable, then medicine can be started. Medicine is important as abnormal lipid profile increases one's risk of cardiac events in the future.
One important thing on which I cannot emphasize enough would be decreasing your weight. If you can gradually decrease your weight even by a few pounds, you would see a lot of these medical problems would get better  by themselves.
You may follow up after two to three weeks.

Yes, raised mole is definitely  suspicious.
But, frankly speaking, by seeing just photos or even seeing live it is very difficult to say that it has cancerous property or not.
The best thing is to get it checked and get the definite result. Excision biopsy is the best way to identify it.
Through biopsy, the entire mole would be removed, we do the treatment as well as diagnosis by sending it to pathology.
Any sudden change in color, texture, size and margin are indicator of melanoma. But, let us not jump into conclusion before biopsy.
I would suggest you to definitely go to dermatologist for proper checkup.

Moles are of various kinds. Some moles are non-pigmented.
It is normal for a pigmented mole to regress and disappear, as it is to become raised above the surface of skin.
That is not a cause of concern, especially when your doctor had ruled out any atypicality of the mole.
Moles are of concern if they  show a sudden increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc.
In that case, a biopsy  or dermascopy should be done to determine the true nature of the lesion.

Definitely  this mole with the large circular area is suspicious. There is a high chance that this mole could be cancerous.
I would suggest you to get a biopsy done as this is a doubtful mole.
Any acute change in size, texture, margins  and color of a mole is an alarming sign. And your mole is increasing in size with very weird shape.
Get the biopsy done and send the sample for a checkup.
As your family history and your own history shows that you are a prone case of precancerous mole changes. So, yes, these moles are suspicious and needs a proper checkup.

This is molluscum contagiosum, which is a viral disease and spread by contact (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Contact can be sexual or nonsexual. But, in your case it is sexual as the molluscum is present in the genital area.
It is STD (sexually transmitted disease). So, we have to check other diseases also like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and hep B (hepatitis B virus) test.
Do not touch it as it will spread by touching. Otherwise, it may infect to other parts too.
Treatment is very simple. You have to go to a local dermatologist and he will give local anesthesia by injection or by applying cream, which ever suits you.
After making that area numb, doctor would puncture the entire lesion one by one and remove the whitish material completely. This whitish material contains virus, so once it removed everything would be healed and you will be cured.
I suggest that you must check out HIV and hep B test for further evaluation.

You just explained about your problem of severe itching in the scrotum. Do you have lesion or rashes or swelling of the skin or just itching?
The treatment you are taking is for fungal. As you said you have itching on scrotum, fungal mainly involves groin area and typically ring like rashes are present.
Itching in scrotum could be something else. Two common diseases are scrotal dermatitis and scabies.
If you have only itching in scrotum with no other skin changes, then it cannot be fungal and you are taking wrong treatment.
So, please explain everything like any other skin changes with itching. Is itching more at night? Also, do any of your family member or friends circle have itching problem?
First, make sure whether you really have fungal or something else.

There are two diagnoses, which matches with your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and symptoms.
The first one is infected nevus sebaceous and the second one is infected wart.
Now let us differentiate the two diseases. Nevus sebaceous is a type of birthmark, which may be remain unnoticed. Now, it is infected and so become tender and symptomatic.
Wart is a viral infection. Sometimes, it grows on the scalp like this. Due to touching, it becomes infected and tender.
The treatment plan is as follows. First, I suggest an antibiotic cream like Mupirocin cream on it for seven days to reduce the infection.
Then, I suggest oral antibiotics like Augmentin 625 mg (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate) twice in a day for seven days. It will becomes dry and non tender once infection subsided.
Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent. Once it become dry and non-tender, go for removal of the lesion.
In both cases, either wart or nevus, you have to get it removed by radiofrequency or surgically.

If there is a change in color, size, margin and shape in a pre-existing mole, especially in this age, then it is always an alarming sign.
 As you said it is changing its texture and color, then yes definitely. We should suspect about melanoma.
In your case it is very difficult to say either it is a just normal change in a mole or precancerous change.
You have to get a simple excisional biopsy. It is a very simple 10 minute procedure in which we take out hole mole from the skin by the help of punch and sent to the laboratory for investigation. If it comes cancerous, then we further can go for small surgery to clear the margins.
Skin heals normally after biopsy and it is a day care process. I would suggest you to get a biopsy done to clear all the doubts.

These are nothing, just glands (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is called a penile pearly papule.
These are glands, which become enlarged. These glands are sebaceous and oil gland, which secrets fluids and keep the penile area wet.
It is a normal thing and does not require any treatment.
Your fever has no relation with with this and may be due to touching it again and again it becomes painful. So, be relaxed and forget it.

Have you applied anything over these eruptions? Any past history of similar kind of eruptions? Are you on any supplements or medicine?
Is there any history of insect bite or mosquito bite? These are all the questions required for making your diagnosis.
With that much of the descriptions I can say it may be allergic contact dermatitis or insect bite hypersensitivity or urticarial vasculitis.

The darker one is the lesion of lichen sclerosus chronicus. For this, you may apply Tenovate GN cream (combination of Clobetasol Propionate and Neomycin sulfate) over it twice daily for two weeks.
The skin colored lesion may be an acquired nevus. A skin biopsy is required for confirmation.
Biopsy is more important if it suddenly changes the size and character. Otherwise, it is a benign lesion and nothing needs to be done.
Pain is not a symptom of these lesions, but may be coincidental.

I have read  your query and examined your picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
It seems that you are having molluscum contagiosum and a few of them are secondarily infected.
Molluscum contagiosum virus will cause multiple or single raised skin lesion.
The papules are umbilicated and contain a caseous plug.
This virus may sometimes get inoculated along the small skin injury, such as from shaving which is known as autoinoculation.
This virus gets transmitted through direct skin contact, through swimming pool or it could be transmitted  sexually (STD).
Investigations to be done:1. Skin biopsy.

2. HbsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV (anti-hepatitis C virus) and HIV to rule out sexually transmitted disease.Differential diagnosis:1. Molluscum contagiosum

2. Folliculitis.Probable diagnosis:Molluscum contagiosum with secondary infection.Treatment plan:1. Generally, it is self-limited and heals spontaneously after several months. Curettage or enucleation is a more effective treatment.

2. I suggest you to take tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days and topical Mupirocin ointment local application twice daily for five days.

Dermatosis neglecta is a condition that results from inadequate frictional cleansing leading to accumulation of corneocytes, sebum and sweat. It ultimately results in hyperpigmented patch or verrucous plaque.
As this disease can be easily treated by simple scrubbing with soap water and alcohol either passively or actively.

I want to share few facts about leprosy.
Leprosy is contagious, because Mycobacterium leprae is transmitted from one person to another by droplet infection through nasal or respiratory mucosa or by direct contact in susceptible persons.
All persons exposed to this disease do not develop it. Specific deficiency in the cell-mediated immunity of the host towards the Mycobacterium leprae plays an important role in acquiring this infection.
Overcrowding, poor hygiene and inadequate housing favor the transmission of the disease by causing more intimate contact.
If your family member has BL (borderline lepromatous leprosy) or LL (lepromatous leprosy) type of leprosy, then chances of getting leprosy by contact are much higher than TT (tuberculoid leprosy) or BT type (borderline tuberculoid leprosy).
You should get slit skin smears for AFB - acid fast bacilli. Also check for the signs below.
Hypoesthetic skin lesions (numb patch).
Thickened peripheral nerves - cord like painful structure of your limb.
Demonstration of AFB.
If any two of the above or a positive histopathological picture confirms the diagnosis, then you should start multidrug therapy.

I have gone through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
These are looking like PUPP - Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy or it can be  AEP - atopic eruption of pregnancy. In both cases the treatment is the same and there is no risk to the fetus.
These are allergic reaction due to so many chemical  and hormonal changes in pregnancy.
Being a dermatologist, I consider it as a normal thing. I would not suggest any medicines for it because once delivery done, this problem also goes off.
For the treatment, I suggest you the safest medicine during pregnancy is tablet Polaramine 6 mg (Dexchlorpheniramine) two to four times in a day if itching is too much.
Use potent steroid cream like Clonate lotion (Clobetasol Propionate) mixed with Dermadew Aloe lotion both mixed in 50% - 50% and apply it over lesions for 15 days.
You can take injection Avil (Pheniramine) once in a day as it is safe, but try to avoid because medicine it can give you relief. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent.
I would not advise you to have LCZ (Levocetirizine). Although, it is a safe medicine, but we already have more potential and more safest medicine for itching (Polaramine).

I have gone through your query and I have understood it.
It can be a candidal infection.
Classical candidal infection presents with the following signs and symptoms like itching, redness, edema, white deposition and linear cracks all around on the inner surface of the prepuce.
Rather than using just a plain antifungal cream, I would suggest you to use a topical steroid and antifungal combination cream (Clotrimazole and Beclomethasone) twice daily for seven days.
I would also suggest an oral antifungal either Fluconazole 150 mg single dose or Itraconazole capsules 100 mg twice daily for a week.
An oral antihistamine like Cetirizine once daily would provide you symptomatic relief from itching. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent.
Also, you should get your blood sugar level checked.

Well, here I discuss everything one by one.
You had rosacea and for that you were using Noritate (Metronidazole) and Ziana (combination of Clindamycin phosphate and Tretinoin).
Since how long you were using these medicines? For rosacea, new creams have come which are better than these above creams. Tacroz 0.03 % (Tacrolimus) would be the better option than these creams. Apply it on rosacea part every night.
You have developed pigmentation which is melasma and for that you got the Tri-Luma (combination of Fluocinolone acetonide, Hydroquinone and Tretinoin) and you applied it.
Now, the problem is Tri-Luma contain 0.05% retinoic acid, which highly irritating and almost burn the skin. So, I never ever give such high combination.
I am not sure about it, but my 90% patient not able to apply such a high 0.05% retinoic acid or Tretinoin combination cream. So, you are developing redness, buring, irritating sensation and dryness after apply this cream. It is really not a good combination.
If you check the Ziana cream it also contain Retinoic acid (Tretinoin), so it also causes dryness. Do not apply it on perioral dermatitis as it will worse the problem. This cream is not hypoallergic, but antiacne.
Skin tanning is the side effect of excessive sunlight exposure. I explain treatment and precautions pointwise manner.
Avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. Wear sun glasses, caps and cover exposed part of the body all the time.
Use sunscreen thrice in a day like 10 o'clock, 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock all over the face. Sunscreen SPF should be around 50. Never stop sunscreen even if melasma go off.
Use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented part like Kojiglo cream (Kojic acid) or Depiwhite cream, but not your combination.
The ideal treatment is Glycolic acid peels. Sittings of 6-8 peels must be required.
Never stop sunscreen even if melasma go off.
For perioral dermatitis, Do not use Ziana cream on it. Apply mild steroid like Flutivate cream. It is a good one. Do not rub any cream just apply in less amount.
Now, I want to say that the Tretinoin, which is in both Ziana and Tri-Luma is causing your problem worse. So, do not use it.

It seems that you are having stasis dermatitis. It is a common inflammatory skin disease in middle-aged and elderly patient.
Stasis dermatitis occurs more commonly on the lower extremities.
It is usually the earliest cutaneous manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency due to overweight or prolonged standing, which lead to pooling of blood and percolate in the dermis resulting in inflammation and cause dermatitis.
The Probable causes:1. Overweight.

2. Prolonged standing.Investigations to be done:Color Doppler for venous insufficiency.Differential diagnosis:1. Stasis dermatitis.

2. Lichen simplex chronicus.Probable diagnosis:Stasis dermatitis.Treatment plan:1. Keep the area clean with soaking in solution of Potassium permanganate in 1:10,000 dilution.

Facial warts occur due to human papilloma virus and some people are more susceptible to it due to some complex immunological parameters.
They are too notorious to recur and avoid shaving for some time. Also, the probable treatment is electrocautery.
Going to the swimming pool will not affect their behavior as you are already infected. But, you should use separate towels to prevent other susceptible person getting infected.
We are having a good response to high dose Zinc given for at least eight weeks. I suggest you to take a tablet Ascazin (Zinc) three times daily for eight weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent.
Zinc has no side effect if taken orally and it boosts natural immunity to this virus.
Consult a dermatologist and ask for electrocautery. This is equally good in destroying them in expert hands.

With your descriptions, it seems that you had undergone bariatric surgery or vibration plate machines to dissolve the fats.
In the case of weight loss surgery, the skin shrinks and sagged since skin is an elastic living organ. Because of the loss of elasticity, the skin pores gets bigger.
Direct contact with vibration plate machines like the sauna belt can cause burns to the skin, which leads to discoloration. So, you should wear a shirt under the belt to provide a barrier between you and the belt.
Attend to your hydration needs. Water is a crucial component of maintaining skin elasticity.
From both food and drink, you should take at least two liters of water each day.
Increase you intake of protein-rich foods such as cottage cheese, milk, legumes, tofu, beans, seeds, nuts and fish all contain collagen and elastin forming components.

The darker skin tone can be attributed to tanning and also ones natural color. I therefore recommend you daily sunscreen, use it 20 minutes prior to going outside.
Using a night cream like ISIS Neotone night serum everyday  at night for two to three months will help, but you need to be regular.
For additional skin whitening, you require skin treatment like skin whitening chemical peels and laser sessions to be honest.
Secondly, the problem of  loss of hair in the beard area is a common thing that I see in my practice. This requires a close up examination. In all likelihood it would be alopecia areata.
We need to give serial injections and also apply a tube by the name of Tacroz Forte 0.1% (Tacrolimus) at night and apply sunscreen during the day.
Both the treatments have to be done together for the beard to show the fastest results. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

I have read your concern and examine your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
It looks like you are having syringoma or sarcoidosis.
Syringoma is a noncancerous skin tumor formed by well-differentiated ductal elements. It is usually asymptomatic.
Also, syringoma will be seen with itching occasionally.
We need to do deep biopsy to rule out syringoma from other disease like microcystic adnexal carcinoma. Sometimes, rebiopsy is required.
As syringomas are embedded within the deep layer of skin, complete removal cannot be achieved.
Possible treatments include the following, which should be done by dermatosurgeon only.
Excision followed by suturing.
Cryotherapy.
Trichloroacetic acid cautery.
CO2 laser (carbon dioxide laser).

I have read your concern and understand your problem. I have gone through your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Periorial dermatitis is a common skin problem with itchy or tender small red papules. The papules usually occur around mouth, nose, eyes and occasionally in the genital area.
The Probable causes:1. Activation of the innate immune (genetically determined) system.

2. Epidermal barrier dysfunction.

3. Altered cutaneous microflora due to the application of multiple medicinal products like topical steroid, steroid inhaler, cosmetics, fluorinated toothpaste.

4. Neglecting to wash the face and hormonal changes.Differential diagnosis:1. Steroid rosacea.

2. Perioral dermatitis.Probable diagnosis:Perioral dermatitis.Treatment plan:1. Taper the topical steroid cream use. Also, stop using other cosmetics and sunscreens.

2. Do not stop the steroid cream suddenly as it may lead to flare up. So, just replace it with less potent cream.

3. After tapering the topical steroids, I suggest liquid or gel sunscreen like suncross soft gel SPF 50+.

4. Also, I would like to suggest capsule Doxycycline 100 mg once daily for four weeks and apply topical 0.03% Tacrolimus once during the night.

5. Do not use soap. Instead, use face wash with warm water to clean the face while the rash is present.Preventive measures:Avoidance of topical steroids and occlusive face creams.Regarding follow up:Revert back after a month to a dermatologist online.--->

The wound is quite big and it definitely require plastic surgery.
If you wait for healing by secondary intention, then your wound may take around four to six months for complete healing. But, it should be under good antibiotic cover and definitely it will leave a big scar mark.
If you go for flap surgery, then definitely it will be very good options in your case. Please consult a plastic surgeon for more details.

Stop that cream immediately. It is a fungal infection and you are using a wrong cream. Also keep the following precautions in mind.
Do not keep the area wet at all. Use powder frequently to keep it dry.
Avoid itching and do not scratch it. Change the undergarments regularly.
Do not apply any general or steroid cream like Betnovate (Betamethasone), etc.
Do not stop the medicine once you cure. Continue the medicine for a long time to completely kill the fungus.
Avoid excessive sweating and wet clothes. Check diabetes and thyroid because in this case, it is really recurrent even after proper treatment.
Regarding treatment, I suggest Ketoconazole cream plus tablet Terbinafine 250 mg for two months or Terbinafine cream plus Fluconazole 150 mg twice in a week for two months or tablet Itraconazole 200 mg once a day for a month along with any of the cream above.

These lesions seem to be genital warts (condyloma acuminata).
It is a contagious disease, caused by human papilloma virus. Generally, two thirds of individuals who have sexual contact with a partner with condyloma acuminata develop lesions within three months.
Oral, laryngeal or tracheal mucosal lesions are transferred by oral-genital contact and anal intercourse can transfer lesions in perianal area.
Needs to rule out immunosuppression by doing certain investigation like HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV (anti-hepatitis C Virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory).

Many people with long-term steroids application have no effect on the redness. However, you stop the ointment immediately.  Otherwise, your skin will get them even more and in the future nothing can be done.
For the clinical diagnosis of rosacea I would like to get three pictures of face in the daylight, one front and two side views.
Some questions before we proceed, does the condition increase during periods of heightened emotional or physical stress anxiety or physical exercise?
How many glasses or cups of tea or coffee do you have in a day?
Have you had any past incidences of stones? What is your cholesterol and triglyceride level?
Please revert back to me with the pictures and the answers to the above question which will help me to understand better and right to get management. Thank you.

With your description it seems that you are having tinea cruris, a kind of fungal infections.
You immediately stop Quadriderm (a combination of Betamethasone Valerate, Gentamicin, Tolnaftate and Clioquinol). It is a steroid containing cream. It will hide the lesion rather than solving it.
I suggest tablet Terbinafine 250 mg once daily for four weeks and 1% Clotrimazole cream twice daily for around two months and one KZ soap (Ketoconazole) for bathing.
Initially you may feel slight increase in lesions. Because, these hide lesions reappear but you should take these medicine as advised and follow certain measures.
It used to occur in people with diabetes, hypertension or on any other medications for immunosuppression.
More common chance of recurrence is due to tight clothing, poor ventilation of that area by wearing frenchie. So, wear loose cotton clothes, old style undergarment and keep the area as dry as possible.
Dry it with good cloth. Whenever the area is found wet, you can apply Abzorb powder (Clotrimazole).
Yes, it can be transferred. But, it is not a dread disease (life-threatening) and almost has nil complication.
It can be easily prevented by above mentioned measures. Fungus always needs humidity and wet area to penetrate. So, just do not give it a chance by keeping it dry.

I have read your query.
It seems that you are having furunculosis. Boils (also called furuncles) are a deep bacterial infection of hair follicles.
The cause of recurrence may be Staphylococcus aureus, which is most commonly carried in the nostrils, armpits, between the legs and in the cleft between the buttocks. It may be transferred to other sites from the nostrils through the finger nails.
General measures to avoid the recurrence are as follows.
If you are overweight, try to reduce your weight and do regular exercise.
Follow a balanced healthy diet with meat, plenty of fruit and vegetables. Avoid smoking.
Wash your whole body once a day with soap or cleanser and water. Wash your hands several times daily or use antiseptic hand rubs.
Do not share your towel with other family members. Maintain a clean handkerchief and do not pick your nose.
Change your underclothes and night attire regularly.
Try to avoid activities that cause sweating and friction from clothing, such as squash and jogging.
If you are iron deficient, a course of Iron tablets may help reduce infection.
Regarding treatment, I suggest oral antibiotics like tablet Augmentin 625 mg (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate potassium) if you are not allergic to penicillin group. Take one tablet thrice daily for five days.
Also, my suggestion is to apply Mupirocin twice daily for five days. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

This is a clear cut case of pityriasis alba (attachment removed to protect patient identity), which is very common in young kids. It is a kind of mild allergy due to sunlight, food or any other external and internal factor.
It is treatable and not a worrisome problem. Some time due to lack of calcium and presence of worms also cause it.
Treatment for pityriasis alba is very simple and almost always effective.
I suggest you tablet Ostocalcium (Calcium phosphate) one tablet every day for one month. Give him milk and good nutritious food.
Tablet Albendazole 400 only one tablet has to be taken.
Apply Flutivate cream (Fluticasone propionate) over the white patches once in night for one month. Do not rub the cream. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
To avoid sunlight allergy just use sunscreen (Suncros 50 SPF) over face twice in a day, which is during morning and afternoon.
Continue this treatment for one month and the problem will be resolved definitely.

There are few misconception  related to Finasteride.
Yes, it is true that it has side effects. Loss of libido and erectile dysfunction are a bit rare.
Finasteride 1 mg every day is the dose recommended by Association of Dermatology and there are so many study and research papers which say 1 mg Finasteride does not affect sexual part of life.
I always give this medicine to unmarried young guys without any side effects.
Study shows if Finasteride dose is more than 5 mg then only the side effect will start in the body, otherwise nothing happens.
Most important thing is that the effect is never ever permanent. It is always reversible and male hormonal level become normal with in three to four weeks.
So, you can take this medicine. But, it is not a permanent solution. It can only delay the alopecia, but cannot stop it forever.

Pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. Remember the following measures to control pimples.
Do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods, chocolates and milk products.
Do not use any steroid creams. Face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. Do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it.
Regarding treatment of pimple, I suggest Clindamycin (Clintop, Faceclin or Clear gel). This is more of preventive and curative, so I tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use Adapalene gel (Adapalene or Differin) over acne in the night.
I also suggest you to take tablet Doxy (Doxycycline) 100 mg once in a day. Consult your doctor, discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent.
If you have acne marks, avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. Wear sunglass, cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time
Use sunscreen thrice in a day such as 10 AM, 12 PM and 3 PM. It has to be applied all over the face. Sunscreen SPF (sun protection factor) should be around 50.
Use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like Kojic acid, Hydroquinone, Depiwhite cream, etc., in the night.
Ideal treatment is Glycolic acid peels. Sittings of six to eight peels must be required.
Post acne scars are three types. Box scar, ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. Pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy.
No cream or tablet can help you out in scars. Best technique is CO2 fractional laser and subscision. It takes five to six sitting, but results are better than any other procedure.
Dermaroller and subscision are also other methods, but less effective than the above.
Fillers do have hiding effect. It fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent.
If scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective.
These are technique you can go through. All procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results.

If you have excess sebum then you can develop acne or seborrheic dermatitis, which can cause itching.
The best way to remove excess of sebum is steaming your face which not only open your closed pores but also reduce the chance of acne and other skin disease.
You should do frequent face wash with water and use alcohol and acetone free face wash twice.
Apply non-greasy moisturizing lotion.
Eat healthy diet with lots of fruits and salad. Also avoid oily and spicy food.
Take plenty of water daily which hydrate your skin and do regular exercise.

Avoid excessive cleansing of your skin. Use soap or face wash not more than two to three times a day.
Plain water can be used to cleanse whenever required. Pat dry your skin after washing it.
Keeping your skin moisturized is the key to healthy looking skin. Pick a good quality moisturizer (Rejuva oil and Vitamin E) with SPF (sun protection factor) for mornings.
Keep your lips happy and healthy with liberal application of lip balm.
Though it is very tempting to have a hot water shower, it should be best avoided. Hot water tends to dry your skin.
Use a body moisturizer within three minutes after your shower or bath to avoid dry skin.
Skin is the mirror of internal organs. Staying healthy is necessary to look healthy. Stay well hydrated and get adequate sleep.
Include Omega 3 fatty acids in your diet (especially beneficial in psoriasis), fruits, vegetables and nuts.
Exercise increases blood circulation to your skin and keep it healthy.
Avoid smoking and alcohol as Nicotine causes premature ageing and makes your skin appear dry and dull.

I have seen your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and well understand your concern.
You are having lichen simplex chronicus (LSC).
It arises because of repetitive scratching or rubbing. I could see thickening of the skin with variable flakes.
Lichen simplex chronicus usually described as stable, itchy and thickened one or more areas. However, thickening of the skin occurs on any location that the patient can reach, like nape of neck, extensor forearms and elbows, scrotum, upper medial thighs, knees, lower legs and ankles.

I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. Also I have viewed the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
This is irritant dermatitis which has developed due to the use of vinegar. It is very less probable that the fungal infection has been cured.
Proper oral and topical medicine for one or two months is needed to cure your disease.
Remember to wear loose cotton clothing especially when at home.
Avoid hot humid climate, keep the affected area dry and avoid synthetic innerwear.
If  any other family members are affected, they must also be adequately treated to prevent recurrence. Also get your blood  sugar levels tested.
Is it still itchy? Any increase in size of the lesion since last few days? How long did you use cider vinegar?
Meanwhile, you may apply antifungal cream such as Clotrimazole twice daily over the lesions of ringworm.

I have read your concern and examined your given pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
With your given descriptions it looks like ingrown hairs.
The most common cause of ingrown hairs is shaving, waxing and tweezing unwanted facial and body hair.
By removing hair and leaving the sharp tip of the hair so short and close to the skin surface, it is more prone to grow sideways or curl back into the hair follicle and get stuck under the skin surface, leading to irritation and inflammation of the overlying skin.
Treatment for ingrown hairs can vary and sometimes the ingrown hair will heal spontaneously without any specific treatment at all.
You can use topical steroid cream like 0.1% Mometasone cream once daily. Application for one to two weeks will decrease inflammation.
You can also use Retino-A 0.025% (Tretinoin) for local application during night for same duration to dislodge keratin so ingrown hairs come out. Consult your specific doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.
Review after two weeks for further management.

This condition is very much related to lifestyle. In females it is mostly due to stress, poor sleep, poor nutrition and excessive blood loss due to menstruation and excessive work load.
Other condition like fever, typhoid, malaria, thyroid and long-term chronic disease can cause it.
It can be due to sun exposure and tanning. Sometime, it is also natural due to depressed eye socket face structure.
Treatment are as follows:
Have good sleep and eat healthy fruits and green vegetables.
Take Iron and multivitamins like Follihair for at least three months.
Check your blood hemoglobin. If it is less then should start with Iron and Folic acid supplements.
Check thyroid and diabetes to rule out other causes.
Use sunscreen 50 SPF. But, face wash and soaps are not treatment. Use Ahaglow (Glycolic acid), which is better than others.

Since you are having fungal infections from last six months, have you tried anything before Terbinafine?
I am asking to rule out any applications of topical steroid containing antifungal which can lead to tinea incognito (fungal infection masked due to application of topical steroid) and delayed the cure rate.
Since Terbinafine is not effective, I suggest you to take tablet Itraconazole 100 mg once daily for one to two months.
Also you can apply topical Ketoconazole cream twice daily till the complete resolution of lesions even beyond you have to continue for few more weeks.
Follow preventive measures like keep your body folds dry. Also can apply Clotrimazole powder if sweating is more.
You can use Ketoconazole soap for bathing and then get a review with picture.

First I do want to make sure that recurrence of wart after 11 years is almost impossible.
Now you can get genital wart only after exposure due to sexual contact done recently.
The second possibility of untreated or remaining part of wart also impossible as in 11 year untreated wart would have become significantly large in size and would never remain unnoticed all these years.
The penile pearly papule and wart are very different condition and can be recognized by photos. If you are able send me photos of your condition I would definitely tell you what it is.
Penile pearly papule is not a disease or any treatable condition. It is just sweat and sebaceous gland which are a bit bigger in size. These are small, multiple and arranged around the penile skin. It does not increase in size, totally asymptomatic and natural thing.
Wart has rough surface. They appear four to five in number. It will appear after a sexual contact history within a month.

You should not have scratched it, because the chances of malignancy increase in otherwise benign mole.
Presently what I can see is the erosion (attachment removed to protect patient identity) so at this stage even dermoscopy would not be able to find out malignancy.
So, best policy at this time is to use Mupirocin ointment twice daily in order to subside or prevent infection. Once the erosion is subsided then you can go for dermoscopic and histologic examination to confirm the nature of mole.

For best result, a thin layer of Alclor solution should be applied on the affected area as the last thing before retiring to the bed at night, where it should be left for six to eight hours.
The skin should be thoroughly washed in the morning. After daily application of a few weeks, the frequency of use may be reduced to alternate nights or even once or twice a week as needed.

You have natural red hair means you have more pheomelanin.
Hair color is determined by the amount of two pigments called eumelanin and pheomelanin, which present in your hair.
The amount of eumelanin in your hair gives you a range from blonde to black. A little amount gives blonde, an intermediate amount gives you brown and more of eumelanin gives out black. Pheomelanin gives red color to the hair.
The amount of eumelanin and pheomelanin present in your hair is genetically determined by the action of your MC1R gene (melanocortin 1 receptor).
These hairs as age progress can turn into brown and that is why you should not dye the red hair.

I can understand your concern.
Being a dermatologist observes in day-to-day activity few diseases have bad impact on lifestyle, out of which eczema is one of them.
But, with your descriptions it seems to be atopic dermatitis, which becomes better as age progress.
In adults, it involves the flexural surface eventually localizing to the front of elbows and behind the knees.
You need not have to worry that much. Besides medicine, you should do some yoga exercises, which will help you much.
Few general measures you have to follow are:
Moisturizer (coconut oil)  should be applied two to three times daily.
Not to use hot water for bath and it should be lukewarm.
Do not rub your skin after bath and it should be slightly wet.
In case of oozing, avoid ointment or cream, corticosteroids in lotion form may be used. When there is no oozing  or in dry eczemas, corticosteroid cream is to be applied locally twice a day.
Local antibiotic cream with or without corticosteroid is helpful where bacterial infection is present.
Investigations to be done:Skin biopsy needs to be done to confirm the diagnosis.Differential diagnosis:Atopic dermatitis.Regarding follow up:Revert back for regular follow up to a dermatologist online.--->

Two possibilities are there if you have history of bite anything then it could be blister beetle dermatitis.
If it has unilateral involvement associated with burning pain fever body ache then it could be herpes zoster.
Second possibility is more common in your case since old age is there and you are a diabetic.
Episodes of herpes zoster are generally self-limited and resolve without intervention.
Since diagnosis of herpes zoster is based primarily on the history and physical findings  you must visit nearby dermatologist for further physical evaluation.

Since you are using face products over face, have you done patch test over face before starting?
I would like to tell you, always do patch test over face before starting any new face product.
Method of patch test is that you should apply little amount of face product over postauricular area and wait for at least 24 to 48 hours. If you feel no burning or redness over the applied area then only you should continue application.
Now, the treatment plan is to stop using face product. Apply 1% Hydrocortisone cream twice daily for five days and take tablet Levocetirizine once daily for five days.

Your mother's condition seems to be senile purpura.
Senile purpura is a common benign condition characterized by recurrent formation of purple ecchymoses (bruises) on the extensor surfaces of forearms following minor trauma. It is basically a defect not a disease.
It occurs due to minor trauma or blood thinner agent. It may also occur because of aging and photodamage. The dermal tissues become thin and increase the fragility of blood vessels. As a result of which superficial vessels tear and rupture even with negligible trauma.
Since this is a benign condition and self-resolving condition, you have to protect your mother from sunlight and minor trauma.
She can use broad spectrum sunscreen like Suncros Soft SPF 50+ over photo-exposed areas.
She can also apply topical steroids like Mometasone twice daily for four to five days to achieve faster recovery and tablet Vitamin C once daily for a week.

Your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are a bit blurred and these are tiny small papules. Are they itchy? There are two to three possibilities. I will mention it one by one.
First is drug reaction - As you had undergone surgery, you must be taking many antibiotics and others. There could be drug reaction. Is there any mouth ulcer? Do you have burning sensation in urine? Are there any rashes?
Mosquito or insect bite reactions - Sometimes, it happens due to bite reaction. Itching is the main feature. It would remain over body for a week and will disappear away slowly.
Chemical reaction - Could be due to antiseptic chemical applied during operation. Itching and redness would be the main feature, but its possibilities are less.
It seems that chance of drug reaction is more than the other.
You have to discuss with your doctors and rule out it. You can change the medicine after consulting with your doctor.

Tinea cruris is a fungal infection and yes it will get cured by those medications. But, chance for recurrence is always there.
It use to occur in people with diabetes,  hypertension or on any other medications for immunosuppression.
More common chance of recurrence is due to tight clothing,  poor ventilation of that area by wearing frenchie. So, wear loose cotton clothes, old style undergarment and keep the area as dry as possible.
Dry it  with good cloth. Whenever the area is found wet, you can apply Abzorb powder (Clotrimazole).
Yes, it can be transferred. But, it is not a dread disease (life-threatening) and almost has nil complication. It can be easily prevented by above mentioned measures.
Look fungus always needs humidity and wet area to penetrate. So, just do not give it a chance by keeping it dry.

You child has atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis). He scratched it a lot and so the lesion got infected. Basically, two things have to be in mind. 
First, we need to treat atopic eczema.
Secondly, treat infection due to uncontrolled scratching in eczema.
Atopic eczema is very common problem, as age increases it goes of itself.
Keep the skin moisturized. Use some good moisturizer and apply it four to five times in a day. More the skin is hydrated lesser the itching.
Avoid exposure to dust, chemical, powder, irritant clothes, spicy food and sea food.
Cut the nails and keep body clean. Avoid over use of soap and shampoo as these are too chemical only.
Use steroid cream like Diprovate (Betamethasone dipropionate), Clonate (Clobetasol propionate) over itchy eczema. It should not be applied on infected, crusted and bled part.
Antihistamines are a must. Give syrup Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 2.5 mL thrice a day.

Let me explain everything about hair fall.
100-150 hair fall every day is very normal. So, it should be considered as hair loss only if the number of hair falls more than this. 
Generalized hair fall in female is mostly due to stress, poor sleep, poor nutrition and excessive blood loss due to menstruation. 
Stress alopecia is also common in which female keeps their hair very tight in certain manner which creates tension in root and cause hair fall. 
Straightening and other procedure also cause weakness of root. Other condition like fever, typhoid, malaria, thyroid, etc., can also cause hair fall, but these are less common. 
Regarding treatment, have good sleep. Eat proper food with green vegetables and fruits. Take Iron and multivitamin like Follihair for at least three months. 
Check your blood hemoglobin. If it is less, then she should start iron and folic acid supplement. Also, check thyroid and diabetes to rule out other cause.

I had a look at your photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
You are currently having acne grade 3. In my opinion the best treatment for your acne would be a mild cleanser like Epiduo-OTC (combination of Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide) face wash.
Use it once in the morning while taking a bath and once at night, bedtime.
Make sure to remove any makeup and keep your face free of any sweat or oil before you apply the Epiduo gel. Apply the gel only over the pimples with a light hand. Do not press, rub or prick your pimples.
In my opinion you need to take antibiotic Capsule Minoz (Minocycline) 100 mg once before lunch every day for 14 days.
With this treatment your pimples should reduce and please follow up after 12 days. Depending on your acne condition after 12 days, I will change your medication. We will make sure that your pimples will not bother you in near future.

I welcome you and want to assure you need not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns.The Probable causes:It occurs due to deficient hygienic conditions of the genitalia.



Please do not worry as it can easily be managed. The best part of it is that there is no pain or itching in it.



It is caused by either fungi or due to the fungal growth. Treatment with proper topical creams will help you get better in a short time.Treatment plan:Apply Hydrozole (Hydrocortisone and Clotrimazole) cream and Triple antibiotic cream (Bacitracin zinc, Neomycin sulphate and Polymyxin B sulphate) on the lesion twice daily.Preventive measures:1. Take plenty of clean drinking water.

2. Keep a balanced and healthy diet to help improve your immunity as such problems also originate when we have a low immunity.

4. Pull the foreskin backwards and wash the area with water after every urination. Then wipe it dry with a clean paper towel. Make it a habit. The moisture underneath the foreskin makes room for growth of the pathogens.Regarding follow up:For further information consult a dermatologist online.--->

Fordyce spots usually do not occur at that site, as they are ectopic sebaceous glands. They are most commonly found over normal skin covering the penis especially undersurface.
The two possibilities are tyson gland and skin tag.
Tyson gland: the site and look these structures are almost the same as in the photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have sent. They are also sebaceous gland like those of fordyce spots but here different term is used.
Skin tag: Yes, they can mimic like anything.
Very rarely, hirsuties coronae glandis can also remain localized to a particular area instead of surrounding the whole corona.
Treatment is not needed. But, if you still want to go for removal, then go for electrofulguration or laser.

I have gone through the details (attachments removed to protect patient identity) provided by you.
You seem to have a fungal infection of skin called tinea cruris. It is commonly called as ringworm.
Due to inappropriate treatment it might have spread extensively.
You could use Sertacide (Sertaconazole) cream twice daily for at least a month. You can take Cetirizine tablet to control itching.
You also require oral tablets like Terbinafine or Azoles as the infection is widespread. Kindly see your dermatologist for proper physical evaluation and prescription.
Alongside, keeping the area clean and dry by use of a sweat absorbing talc helps healing faster.
As it can spread to others by contact, it is advisable to treat others whom you live with if they have it too.

Optimum zinc and biotin levels are key.
Use a broad bristle comb and avoid over strenuous combing of hair.
Never shampoo in dry hair.

I understand your concerns.
In most instances, it is best to not let the infection develop as that is the best strategy to deal with after effects of disease manifestation.
However, in most cases like yours, the pigmentation is likely to subside with time.
 Here under, are listed some measures that will help in faster clearance in most cases, as this is my observation on patients in my practice:
Avoid friction.
Wash or sponge frequently.
Avoid chemicals and perfumes like deodorants on this area.
Use antioxidants, referred to in previous post.
Avoid sun exposure.
If possible, get culture sensitivity of pus from lesions done as antibiotics might be needed in persistent cases.
My best wishes and take good care of yourself.

According to me you are having ringworm infection.
I would recommend you to take tablet Terbinafine 250 mg once daily and apply Sertaconazole  cream on the affected area twice  daily. Continue this for three weeks and revert back.
You will definitely notice some improvement. But, do not stop the medicine on your own as recurrence is the most common issue with this condition.
For itching take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg once or twice daily depending on the intensity of itching.
Besides this, keep the area as dry as possible. Avoid sharing of soap and towel, wear loose cotton clothes and stay in cool and airy environment.

I have reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and according to me you have developed an allergic contact dermatitis.
It can be due to anything you have applied on the eyes or due to any volatile substance.
I would recommend you to take tablet Prednisolone 20 mg one tablet daily in the morning after breakfast for five days.
Along with this take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg once or twice daily depending on the intensity of itching.
I do not know whether these medicines will be available as over-the-counter in your country. Do not worry; your eyelids will be normal again.
Avoid applying anything on the face and try to notice whether the swelling is associated with any substance.

Looking at the history and the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) there seems to be a clear correlation.
Betnovate-C (combination of Betamethasone valerate and Clioquinol) is a steroid cream and Quadriderm is a very nonspecific kind of cream.
With prolonged use of a steroid cream is, you tend to have atrophy of the skin which means the upper layer of the skin becomes very thin and paper like. There is a loss of subcutaneous collagen  leading to the appearance of marks which you described in your problem.
All these are collective side effects of using a steroid for a long time. I am sorry to tell you that the side effects are having a very bad prognosis.
However you can start using Silicone-based creams like Contractubex cream three or four times a day and massage properly in the area for the marks.
You may find some relief after using it for a long time. But, the result will not be very satisfactory.
Since you asked me, next time you have fungal infection, apply Candid cream (Clotrimazole) and go to a dermatologist immediately.
Alternatively you can also go in for silicon based mesotherapy.

I can understand your problem. Let me explain the cause and treatment.
Excessive sweating is always associated with armpit odor. It can be due to hormones and bacterial reaction.
Obesity, diabetes, thyroid, etc., also will cause this. As you are overweight must check thyroid and diabetes.
Sometimes, it is natural and not associated with any disease.
Shave the area and keep it dry and clean. You can try Aldry lotion (Aluminium chlorohydrate) which has anti-sweating property. Use deodorants and perfumes.
Avoid fatty and spicy food and also avoid tight clothes.
Botox (Botulinum toxin) is one of the most popular treatments nowadays. We inject this over armpit which cause sweat glands paralysis and totally stops the sweating and so body odor.

I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern.Investigations to be done:It is very difficult to narrow down to one or more causative factors. There are many tests available like patch testing or immunoassays to point out the allergy causing antigens, but practically they are not much useful. However, if there is any family history of autoimmune disorders like thyroid, you may get a thyroid profile done.Probable diagnosis:Chronic idiopathic urticaria.Treatment plan:1. You can continue with Cetirizine.

2. Alternatively, you may take Loratadine 10 mg or Hydroxyzine 25 mg (at night). The side effects are quite rare especially if the dose is taken after a variable gap of few days.Preventive measures:You may apply Calamine lotion as a soothing agent.Regarding follow up:For further information consult a dermatologist online.--->

I can appreciate multiple scars on your face. You should continue with Epiduo gel (combination of Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide) and sunscreen, so that the pimples are treated at the earliest and do not leave scars.
You should try to increase the concentration of Retino-A (Tretinoin) from 0.025 percent to 0.05 percent. So, it will become more effective in dealing with your problem. But, be cautious; increased concentration can lead to irritation as well.
Glycolic peels will not be much effective in removal of scars.
Apart from laser treatment you can consider going for microneedling sessions. Multiple sittings are required after every three to four weeks but it helps in reducing 60 to 70 percentage scars.

I can understand your concern. You need to take proper medicine for the treatment of pimples so that dark spots will not appear.
Use a Salicylic acid face wash twice daily and apply Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel on the pimples twice daily. Along with this take a course of tablet Azithromycin 500 mg daily for three consecutive days in a week for six weeks.
For the dark spots apply Tretinoin cream 0.05 percent on the dark spots at night in minute amounts.
Sometimes, dandruff is also associated with pimples. If you have dandruff use Ketoconazole shampoo twice weekly along with tablet Fluconazole 200 mg twice weekly.
Besides this keep your face dry, avoid applying oily creams and moisturizers. You can use cosmetics labeled as noncomedogenic, reduce the intake of sugary foods and avoid direct sunlight.

I will request you to kindly send a better set of pictures limited only to the lesion, as well as describe how the lesion feels to touch whether soft or hard.
Also give me additional details like release of any cheesy material upon pressure from the sides, any oozing of pus, firmness at its base, any satellite lesions, any relationship with similar condition in your partner, and finally if you notice that there is any small depression in the center of roof of lesion.

Well, is it just a five hour history? Are these vesicles increasing in number?
It is looking like chicken pox caused by herpes simplex.
Since this disease is in initial stage, I can just make a provision diagnosis not confirmatory diagnosis. It will become clear in two to three days as chicken pox takes two to three days to come full blown.
The following are the clinical features of chicken pox:
Same vesicles as in photos comes which are fluid filled and itchy.
If you look closely there could be small pin point middle of vesicle are seen which characteristic of herpes.
On and off fever is very common and sore throat too as you have explained.
Most of the time it comes once in life time. So, if your son had not been suffered with this more chance to get it.
Do not hurry as it is totally curable. Just wait for two days. If it is chicken pox more vesicles will come and later you can start treatment.
Treatment is Acyclovir 400 mg five times in a day for 10 days.

It is a small reddish papule. Since how long you have this? Is it painful?
This could be either of these.
Insect bite reaction or small lipoma.
Mastocytoma (mast cell tumor) or melanoma. 
Many other differential diagnoses are there. Being an experienced dermatologist, I want to assure you that no doctor can diagnose it without doing biopsy or FNAC (fine-needle aspiration cytology). As I told there could many differential diagnosis of it, so duration also is an important factor.
If duration is about three to five days, then more chance of any insect bite (which is very common). But, ultimate tool to identify it is by biopsy or  FNAC only. So, I suggest you to go undergo this test procedure to clear it.

Basically you have two queries. First the extra skin which you want to remove. That can be possible by surgery but if you do not have any problem with that then you avoid surgical procedure now.
Second are the patches. Well, let me tell you that your skin is totally normal but you have white patches. I mean to say your penis skin is little dark and that extra white patch is the main problem. This is type of penile vitiligo.
In vitiligo the skin loses its normal dark pigmentation. It is not a dangerous problem and it is not going to impair penile function in future. This problem could be triggered by circumcision or maybe not.
Use Tacroze 0.03% cream (Tacrolimus) once at night over white patches. I again want to emphasize it that the white patches are the problem not the dark one. As I have seen many cases, I am able to identify it. Continue this cream for 20 days and let me know the effect.

ABCDE signs are not absolute, but relative. By that I mean to say, any change in color, symmetry, border, diameter and evolution over a period of time is significant.

Another injection comes that is hyaluronidase. It comes in injection and we have to give it but like filler only. Have to insert this material in filler area which will dissolve the filler.
But, as a cosmetologist I do not prefer it much because action of this enzyme is little uncontrolled and it may dissolve more amount of filler which further disfigure. So, my final decision in this case is just wait and watch for a month at least.

I have read your question and understood your concern.
Melasma can relapse. Therefore, you must continue with a maintenance regime once your melasma clears.
I suggest you to use a higher SPF sunscreen like Sebamed sunscreen SPF 50+. In addition I would suggest you to use Aziderm 20% gel (Azelaic acid) twice daily for dark spots.
In morning use Aziderm after washing face and after 30 minutes, apply sunscreen over it. At night apply Aziderm and leave it overnight.
Aziderm is slower acting, but it is safe. It can also be used for maintenance therapy.
Melalite (Hydroquinone) and Lookbrite (combination of Hydroquinone, Tretinoin and Mometasone furoate) are steroid based creams and cannot be used for more than a month as they can have side effects.

I understand your concern.
From my professional opinion, it looks like tinea with secondary eczematization or in simple words fungal infection with skin damage due to rubbing.
One advice is please do not rub. I understand it can be difficult but try.
Take capsule Forcan (Fluconazole) 200 mg once weekly for four weeks.
Loceryl cream to be applied twice daily for three weeks. Once in the morning after bath and another at bedtime.
Abzorb powder (Clotrimazole) only in groin area (not hips). This is to prevent the infection from reaching the groins.
Tablet Dazit (Desloratadine) to be taken at night for seven nights to relieve itching.
Use separate head towel and body towel. Change underwear every day. No direct soap application over the area. No using Dettol or Savlon also. Just plain water will do.
Do not drink milk or milk products or bread for a week. It contains yeast which is a fungus itself. If we want to kill fungus, we should control yeast intake.
If you have bulky legs that rub with each other, exercise and lose some weight.
Continue the medicines for the time period. Follow up with me after three weeks for a change in cream.
Since this is a chronic condition, it needs to be removed completely to prevent further recurrences.
Even if you feel any reduction in symptoms, complete the medicines for the given time period. This is very important. Hope this solves your query.

As you explained the disease that your wife has multiple small moles over face and hands, it certainly indicates solar lentigines.
It is a multiple freckles type mole due to sun exposure. Now, let me explain the treatment and precautions.
Avoid exposure to sunlight as much as you can. Cover body with clothes and cap while going out. Use sunscreen over face and hand every four hourly till evening. This will prevent further development of disease.
Now to treat existing lentigines we can opt for laser. Creams will not be of much helpful in this. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) will be very useful.
You can consult a doctor around you for this laser. One or two sitting would be enough to remove it completely. There is no side effect. It could be costlier, but results are good.

I have gone through your pictures (attachments removed to protect patient identity) and I would like to summarize it in pointwise manner.
Your lesion gives impression of two diseases. One is fungal and second is eczema. In both the cases, itching persists and  looks same as your pictures.
Now, to get definite diagnosis as you told us that you are using Itch Guard cream since long time but it is not getting cured. This point goes toward fungal infection. Because in eczema, cream helps but not in fungal infection.
I would like to diagnose it as fungal infection and will treat it accordingly.
Take Fluconazole 150 mg twice in a week and Ketoconazole cream twice in a day. Same treatment you should continue for at least three weeks.
For itching, take antihistaminic tablet Teczine (combination of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride and Levocetirizine) 10 mg once in night.
Keep the area dry and clean. Do not touch it again and again and avoid itching.

I have read your query and can well understand your concern. From your question I can understand that this lesion has been present on your foot since long time.
Melanocytic  nevi maybe benign or malignant.  If this lesion has recently changed any character that is increased in size, change in color, uneven pigmentation, etc., and then chances of malignancy are more. Please observe it carefully.
Malignant melanoma is a disorder which carries a high index of suspicion and especially if it occurs on the feet. Hence, we cannot ignore this lesion.
Investigations to be done:Since there is a strong family history, I advise that you should get a biopsy done as soon as possible. A biopsy will determine the true nature of this lesion.Differential diagnosis:1. Melanocytic nevus.

2. Malignant melanoma.

These changes are all due to hormonal changes which occur during pregnancy. So, it is very difficult to treat. It is better to avoid any treatment during this period. Many drugs cannot be given during pregnancy as it can affect child.
Moreover, these changes many times subside after pregnancy or lactation period. So, counseling her is the best choice.
Use a safe soap or cleanser like Cetaphil to wash face.
She can use sunscreens like Shade lotion 2-3 times a day. It helps to prevent darkening of skin.

Yes, you can use all of that.
Isotretinoin, Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) can irritate your skin a lot.
My advise is to continue it only till your acne comes down a bit, but then continue only with Clindamycin.
For photodamaged skin both Isotretinoin and topical Retinoids can help. Tretinoin works better than Adapalene though.
Please do not self-medicate with Isotretinoin. Do it under dermatologist's or physician's supervision only.

You should start with shampoo containing Salicylic acid and Ketoconazole. Use it every alternate day in the beginning. Once you notice improvement gradually taper it to twice weekly and then once weekly.
Along with this apply Clotrimazole and Betamethasone combination lotion on the affected areas of the scalp twice daily.

This provisional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of report or image (attachment removed to protect patient identity)  and is based entirely on inputs provided to me. It should be correlated with clinical findings.
You should know that you are in your teens and getting acne is a common thing.
What we are concentrating is the acne should go away easily without leaving any scars of pigmentation. For that I suggest you use a good daily face cleanser like Spongy Sal foaming face wash.
Do not rub your face after applying it. Just spread it evenly, gently and wash it off. Never use soap for cleaning face. Do this once during the day and once at night.
After cleansing the face at night apply Epiduo gel over the acne (Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide) and apply gently until gel absorbs in skin. Do not massage or rub too vigorously.
You will experience some itching early on but do not worry. The gel will dry up the acne and it will be late off.
Avoid going in the sun directly or if you have to wear a good sunblock off about SPF 50 plus and then go. This is the treatment as of now for your acne.
Follow this for two weeks and give me a follow up. Then I will consider starting other medication gradually as you get more familiarized with the acne treatment.
Hope you follow this regimen carefully and do not stop or overmedicate by yourself.

It is very difficult to treat patients with itching all over body. The duration of itching, your occupation, family history, etc., is not clear.
Observe for any aggravating or relieving  factors, like diet, day or night, temperature, allergies or allergens, etc.
Use a gentle soap or any moisturizing soap.
Take antihistamine like Cetirizine in morning, Atarax (Hydroxyzine hydrochloride) 25 mg in evening for itching.
If any other members in family have travel history at present, then treatment for scabies infestation may be required.
Get treatment for any infection like dental caries or worm infestations in the body.

As far as scars are concerned you can try using Tretinoin 0.05 percent cream on the scars at night. It will not have significant benefit, but you can give it a try.
Otherwise you can consider going for laser treatment, microneedling sessions or surgical correction for the scars.
Besides this, avoid oiling of scalp, keep your face dry, avoid using creams and moisturizers and reduce the intake of sugary foods.
For breast changes and lump, I would recommend you to consult a surgeon as he will be able to guide you better regarding these symptoms.

First thing is, I recommend you to do the following tests:
FSH (Follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) ratio.
Serum cortisol levels both AM and PM values.
Check for ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) levels in blood.
Get the estrogen levels and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels checked.
Get tests for T3 (Triiodothyronine) and T4 (Thyroxine) both bound and free.
I need to know whether your periods are regular or not.
Is there any hairiness on face especially on the chin part?
Please send me clear pictures of entire scalp region where you think you have lost hair. Also let me know the duration of your past treatment.
My advise is you need to eat healthy and eat well.
 Do not skip breakfast. Include maximum protein in breakfast and have at least two big bowls of curd.

Continue with the face wash but Benzoyl peroxide 10 percent is too strong for the face. Instead use Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel on the pimples in the morning and Adapalene gel on the pimples at night.
Along with this take a course of Azithromycin 500 mg daily on 3 consecutive days in a week for at least 4-6 weeks.
This is the mildest oral drug used in acne treatment and hope it works in your case. I do not know whether these drugs will be available over-the-counter in your country.

I have read about your query.
Dryness of the skin depends on the type of the skin individually. Since you are on moisturizer Aveeno, you can continue it with the following tips.
Apply a moisturizer within three minutes of your bath because some amount of hydration should be present on the skin for the moisturizer to act fully.
If you want to apply over noon and evenings, take some amount of lotion and add a few drops of water, mix and apply it.
Please check that the moisturizer has humectants or not. If humectants are present, change the moisturizer with only an emollient content.
Because, humectants will act only in humid climates and not in dry climates as it will draw water from the body itself in dry climates and make the skin more dry.
Investigations to be done:1. Thyroid profile.

2. Fasting blood Sugar.Treatment plan:1. Moisturizer.

2. If cracks and pain are present a mild steroid like Desonide can be mixed with the moisturizer and applied twice daily for two weeks.Regarding follow up:Revert back after a week for follow up to a dermatologist online.--->

I have noted your case details (attachments removed to protect patient identity) and would help you deal with the problem on the basis of my experience with similar cases in my clinic.
Your problem is generally caused by a mite and is manageable.
Please do not use any purely steroidal cream like the one that you are already using as this will mask the original lesion and make difficult both the diagnosis as well as treatment.
It would be better to use a preparation which is mainly anti-itching with a weak steroid like Hydrocortisone.
One such preparation that has helped my patients in a good measure is Crotorax-HC (Crotamiton). This can be applied as often as needed.
Gamma benzene hexachloride (Lindane) in lotion form works best to eliminate the infection. It needs to be used and massaged all over except face and scalp after bath and rubbed vigorously. It has to be followed by two more applications in the same manner at 12 hours gap. It needs to be repeated once a week in the same manner.
Anti-allergic like Levocetirizine 10 mg per day at night has helped almost all patients in relief from symptoms of itching.
Please also ensure that other family members and contacts are not having the infection of this nature. Since the problem may get transferred from one to another.
Separate bed linen and items of personal use like towels also need to be taken care of. I am sure you will be well soon.

You have a body mass index - BMI of 28 which comes in overweight category.
Stretch marks result from excessive stretching of the skin. So, I will highly recommend you to reduce weight by at least 7-8 kg. Once stretch marks are formed, they are hard to treat.
Number of treatments is available with varying success.
CO2 laser (carbon dioxide laser) : This will give you skin tightening over the affected area, but again get treated for visible parts only and not the entire body as it will be quiet expensive.
Nonablative Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser and ER (erbium-doped) glass lasers: These are skin tightening lasers.
Dermaroller and PRP (platelet rich plasma): This is non-laser procedure with platelet rich plasma injected in the stretch mark to induce skin tightening.
Vitamin E capsules: Used with variable success.
Vitamin C tablets: Can be used as supplements.
All of these treatments have varying success rate ranging from no improvement to 50% improvement. For the above treatments you will have to visit a dermatologist.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns.The Probable causes:1. Small abrasions on the glans penis that usually come across during sexual intercourse are healed up at their own. Problem occurs when they get combined with fungal, bacterial or viral attacks.

2. I preferably suggest you to apply K-Y jelly or gel before sex to get lubricated. It is a water based lubricant and has no chemical interaction with the latex of condoms.

3. For fungal infection you need to apply Hydrocortisone or Clotrimazole ointment on the chaffed skin of glans. This ointment will give you ease from abrasions too. You do not need to apply Vaseline especially the days when you will be having a fungal attack too.

4. Using Nystatin powder will make the surface more rough and dries up. That is not good in your case as it may cause more abrasions being dry.

5. Please avoid rigorous sexual intercourse especially in the days when you have fungal growth.

6. To completely wash off the Vaseline you do not need to use anything else. Soap wash with a mild soap like dove is the best option for you.

7. The residual Vaseline you are talking about has nothing to do with latex. It is totally safe and never renders the latex weak.

8. You do not need anything else other than Vaseline to apply on chapped skin (abrasions) when there is no fungal attack. It is a good option and I think it is working well for you.

9. In many of my patients with these issues, I opted in for circumcision and referred them to a general surgeon with very encouraging results. You can also go for the same to get rid of abrasions and fungal infections.Regarding follow up:For further information consult a dermatologist online.--->

She is right and these are common post peel effect.
By looking at your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell that in your condition medicines are very unlikely to effect and chemical peeling and lasers are  the only option.
Glycolic acid is considered as very safe peel. Ask her to use it from very low concentration and gradually increase the concentration so that the tolerance could develop against that peel.
It requires three to four sessions at least to get the visible result.
Always take post peel precautions like avoid sun exposure,  sunscreen and emollients,   in rare cases use Hydrocortisone if there is a frank injury.
Exfoliation of skin is a normal event after the procedure that is why it is known as peeling.
So, I would advise you to stick to the same doctor and follow his or her advice.

I observed that the lesion on your neck is of lichen simplex chronicus or neurodermatitis. It is not of atopic eczema.
Although applying Flutivate (Fluticasone propionate) cream to the neck region is right but never apply it on whole body.
See the morphology is going in favor of drug reaction. Other differential diagnosis includes patch stage of mycosis fungoides, but biopsy is needed to confirm it.
I would suggest you to start with Venusia Max lotion. Apply it thrice daily all over the affected area.

I have read your query in detail and understood your concern.
As far as Betamethasone dipropionate and Zinc sulphate lotion is concerned, it is mainly given for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and hair fall due to it. It has no effect on androgenetic hair loss. Since, you had dandruff this lotion would have helped to reduce hair fall because of it.
Minoxidil is approved for androgenetic alopecia. It should be used in 5% concentration.
During the initial part of therapy with Minoxidil, patients might interpret increased hair shedding. But it is temporary and it is due to new hair growth that pushes telogen hair (shedding of hair during the resting phase of hair follicle) out of hair follicle. 
In addition to Minoxidil I would also suggest you to take a tablet of Finasteride 1 mg once daily.
Tablet Finasteride is also approved remedy for androgenetic alopecia and it slows down further progression of hair loss and thinning by inhibiting an enzyme 5 alpha reductase present in hair follicles. This enzyme is mainly responsible for androgenetic alopecia. It converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT causes thinning and hair fall in androgenetic alopecia.
Together tablet Minoxidil and tablet Finasteride would serve to arrest further progression and also reverse early hair loss and thinning.
The main aim is to preserve existing hair. Therefore earlier the therapy is initiated and continued for long term, better are the results. 
For dandruff you may use Betamethasone lotion once daily at night for 2 weeks and then discontinue with it.
Betamethasone for dandruff should not be used regularly and for long term because it is a potent steroid and can have side effects.
Along with this, I would suggest you to use antidandruff shampoo namely Triatop shampoo. You can continue with this shampoo for a long duration.
My suggestion is, use Betamethasone dipropionate lotion once every night for 2 weeks only along with an antidandruff shampoo for dandruff.
For androgenetic alopecia, I would suggest you to start Minoxidil 5%, 1 ml, twice daily, to be used on the skin of scalp.
In addition, I would like you to start tablet Finasteride (Finax) 1 mg.

As the child grows, the patch might become more visible as the skin gets tanned. There are very less chances that it will increase in size.
No treatment is required now. With age, there are chances for it to disappear.
In adulthood, he can get the patches surgically corrected or even take light treatment. Wait till his puberty and check for any progress.

I have read your query. I have seen the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) also. I understand your concern.
the possibilities for the red patch on your back are lichen simplex chronicus and tinea corporis.
Lichen simplex chronicus is characterized by hyperpigmented patch with roughened skin.
Tinea corporis  is a fungal infection of skin and characterized by red colored scaly rash.
Treatment depends on the diagnosis:
I prefer to advise topical steroid like Mometasone for lichen simplex chronicus.
For fungal infection of skin,  oral and topical antifungals like Fluconazole and Clotrimazole cream is advised.
For back pain you visit an internal medicine specialist in person for physical evaluation.

I can very well understand what you are going through. I will give my best shot to treat your problem. I examined the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and found the original fungal lesions have been converted to the present appearance because of medicine.
It is a common tendency for a person to use local steroids like Quadriderm ointment to get relief quickly. This is when the problem gets complicated.
My advice would be to never use such products. But if already used no need to worry. Once a physical examination is done we can find a good solution.
My suggestions for you to follow are:
Maintain the area dry and use undergarments only when the area is completely free from moisture.
Wear loose cotton undergarments that will absorb all the moisture content.
Cut down intake of spices, caffeinated drinks, fried foods, and alcohol.
Stop using Clocip dusting powder immediately.
I would suggest you to start Eumosone-M cream (Clobetasol propionate) twice a day for a period of seven days. If applying twice is not working and itching does not get better, then you can use it for another one or two time a day.
Most of the patients have found tablet Levocetirizine (Levocetirizine hydrochloride) 5-10 mg beneficial. But, the main draw back of this tablet is, it tends to get the patient drowsy. Tablet Allegra (Fexofenadine) too can be taken.
For fungal infection you can take tablet Terbinafine (Lamisil) 250 mg twice a day.

I checked the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Well, granuloma annulare is self limiting and symptomless condition.
Your biopsy has suggested it to be a case of granuloma annulare.
Intense itching along with purplish plaque is going in favor of lichen planus clinically. I would recommend you to undergo biopsy once again.
I would suggest you to have tablet Prednisolone 50 mg for 15 days daily and check for its response.
In order to reduce the size and symptoms of the disease, you can take intralesional injection Triamcinolone.
If the disease is localized, then you can go for cryotherapy.

Your problem seems to have lingered on to become a chronic hyperkeratotic scrotal eczema.
This is a result of your hyperallergic tendency, constant scratching, sweat induced maceration and intermittent but incomplete treatments with suboptimal medicines.
As of now answer few questions of mine. Are you a known diabetic? If not, then please get it tested.
Do you have a history of generalized dry skin that worsen in winter? Did you have childhood eczema or sinusitis or childhood asthma?
Does your occupation entail a lot of sweating in the groin area? What kind of fabric do you use for undergarments either pure cotton and loose ones or tight synthetic fabric ones?
Till you revert with the answers, I advice you to do the following:
Wash that area twice a day with a moisturizing non-medicated, non neem based soap; like the dove or pears. Removal of sweat by regular washing is important.
Prefer loose cotton undergarments and prefer wearing cotton shorts once you reach home to allow aeration of that area.
Start applying a cream named Tenovate-M (Clobetasol propionate) twice a day over the affected part after bath for seven days and then shift to using Onabet-B or Sertacide-B (Sertaconazole nitrate) cream twice a day for 5 days. Then start with Lulifin cream (Luliconazole) just once at night for two weeks.
If your general health is good, then you must take an oral antifungal as well. Take tablet Terbicip 250 mg (Terbinafine hydrochloride) twice a day for the first week then once a day for next three weeks and complete a course of four weeks.
To reduce itching, you may take a tablet of Levosiz 5 mg (Levocetirizine) or Teczine (Levocetirizine hydrochloride) one tablet at night for 5-10 days.
The Probable causes:1. Sweating.

2. Tight undergarments.

3. Constant scratching.

4. Application of inappropriate creams intermittently.Investigations to be done:1. Blood sugar levels fasting and postprandial.

2. Serum levels of IgE antibodies.Regarding follow up:Follow up in two weeks with pictures to a dermatologist online.--->

I went through the details you have provided and feel it to be an allergic condition of skin known as pompholyx.
Pompholyx generally causes itching of the hands and feet. Since, these body parts directly come in contact with external objects on a day to day basis.
The substances that aggravate this condition are pollen, chemicals in detergents, paints, solvents and rubber materials.
When you have allergy, it is advisable that you stay away from the allergens. There are chances of blisters to be infected. Hence, do not puncture them.
To control itching, I would suggest you to start taking tablet Cetirizine. Based on the severity, you may need oral and topical steroids. Kindly consult a dermatologist for a prescription to the above.
Skin irritation that is caused when you are out in sunlight might be because of rosacea or can also be a cause of sensitivity to a particular wavelength.
For this, I would advice you to start using a sunscreen with a SPF30 (sun protection factor) regularly.
You may also need oral anti-oxidants and photoprotective medications that are prescription based.
Avoid taking hot beverages and spicy foods.

I presume it as tinea capitis or simply a fungal infection of the scalp.
Do not worry, hair can regrow again and there is no permanent damage. It is common in children.
It is very important to start the following early for best results.
Stop oiling the scalp. Oil is food for fungus.
Visit a dermatologist for prescription drug. However, I am suggesting you a shampoo containing Ciclopirox olamine (antifungal).
Apply to wet scalp and leave for two minutes and then rinse off. Continue it for a month with five times weekly shampooing.
Apply Clotrimazole cream twice daily in the affected part for a month. Apply the cream slightly beyond the patch margin to cover invisible fungus in normal looking skin too.
Before we commence treatment, wash baby cap or cloth coming in contact with the baby's head in hot water with some antiseptic. It is crucial to kill the fungus sticking on to the cloth.
Same applies to her comb. Otherwise, it will relapse.

Thank you for your complement.
It is a minor procedure usually requires local anesthesia and of course painless after anesthesia.
Any trained general surgeon would be able to help you with pore or cyst excision.
It may hardly take a suture or two with no or minimal scar. No laparoscopy required.
It is done much above the level of dorsal vein. It is a day care procedure which will take just some minutes. So, it is totally safe.

I have seen the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity).You are having truncal acne.
You should start with tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three consecutive days in a week for three weeks. Along with this take capsule Isotretinoin 20 mg once daily and apply Benzoyl peroxide 10% gel on the pimples twice daily for six weeks.
You should use Ketoconazole soap for bathing. Besides this keep your back dry. Follow some skin care tips such as avoid applying cream and moisturizer, avoid wearing tight clothes and reduce the intake of sugary foods.
Before starting the oral medication get the following tests done. Liver function tests and lipid profile. If these come normal you can start with capsule Isotretinoin and revert back after six weeks as acne is a chronic disease and will take time to resolve.
The Probable causes:Hormonal imbalance and seborrhea.Investigations to be done:1. Lipid profile.

Benzoyl peroxide will not work on your acne as you are having grade 4 acne (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
You need to start Isotretinoin immediately. Let me know your marital status, because you should not get pregnant while on Isotretinoin and at least two contraceptive methods are recommended.
For hair fall and dandruff, use Salisia KT shampoo (combination of Salicylic acid and Ketoconazole) twice weekly and keep it applied for 15 minutes before hair wash.
Nothing to worry about your breast size as it is common to have discrepancies in size. Breast pain should be pre-menstrual if it is occurring in relation to menses.
PCOS and hernia are quite different things and have no relation with each other. Please rule out pcod as it can also be one of the causes for severe acne.
First focus on treating acne and later acne scars would be treated. Diet has no proven role in acne, but still avoid high glycemic diet.
Do not apply baking soda,  lemon, etc., as they can cause irritant dermatitis. 
Acne has nothing to do with burning sensation and it is mainly due to vitamin B12 deficiency.
Apply Acne UV sunscreen, an IPCA product, thrice daily.

It is very normal for around 100 hairs to fall each day. We do not notice this because all of those do not fall at once.
Second of all, I would like to ask you whether is it hereditary on your maternal and paternal side? It is called androgenic hair loss.
With these major queries ruled out, I would shift the focus on diet and sleep. Diet should be regular with lot of greens and milk. Eat a good amount of protein as this should reduce the rate of hair fall and also provide a good body to your thinning hair.
Hair is precious and do not play with it by trying out new brands with overwhelming claims. Stick to a gentle daily cleanser, medicated products is much more quality assured than fancy brands in market. Hence, I suggest you to use products like Kerawash shampoo and a good conditioner.
Washing your hair at least three to four times a week is mandatory.
Conaderm (combination of Ketoconazole and Zinc pyrithione) is good for dandruff. But if there is no dandruff and simply continuing with the anti-dandruff shampoo will eventually cause hair loss on chronic repeated use.
Any medication beyond a particular time period will cause side effect. So, stop using it if the desired result has been achieved. If not then treat the dandruff first.
Only shampoo will not help. You have to take medicines and use an anti-dandruff shampoo at the same time.
Proper way to use an anti-dandruff shampoo is to apply it on scalp rather than the hair and once desired foaming is achieved, let it stay in head for 2-3 minutes so that the medication has got sufficient time to act on your scalp.
Observe a good hygiene wherein you wash your pillow cover every four to five days in summer and seven to eight days in winter. Because the germs causing dandruff can be inside the pillow cover and after you shampoo and clean your hair, it can come and sit there again when you sleep so the treatment has got no effect overall.
If it is a hormonal problem, then we need to start the medicine as soon as possible so that to control the effect of hormones on your hair.
Once desired control is achieved over a period of two months then we can shift the focus on regrowing the lost hair and cover the bald patches.
Send me some clear pictures of your scalp of different parts and we can start treatment as soon as possible.
Do not worry, it is just a matter of time before we control your hair fall and you can have your desired hairstyle done. Stay positive.

I am sure your problem is distressing and is affecting you severely. Let us understand your case.
Since you are a very fair skin type patient, you are naturally more exposed to sun radiation which is UV-A and UV-B (ultraviolet A and B) rays. In effect what it does is, it disrupts the self-healing power of your skin and makes you more vulnerable to sun damage. The damage surmounts over time and the net result is skin changes along with the symptoms you described in your questionnaire.
Microscopically, the cells in the deepest layers undergo irreversible changes and the cellular environment becomes a very rampant scenario where the speed to clear the damaged cells falls short of the rate at which the cells are damaged. So it results in pigmentation, slow or non-healing and damage at the molecular level.
In my professional opinion, gauging from the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) alone my diagnosis goes in favor of discoid lupus erythematosus or DLE. It is a chronic or longstanding skin response to sun damage.
It is a reversible benign condition if we institute the treatment right away. However, if we leave it to change letting time be the healer, it can transform itself into a more severe form of skin condition.
It would include wearing a good sunscreen like SPF50+ (sun protection factor) or SPF70 with PA+++  on a daily basis. It should be applied liberally on all the sun exposed sites of the body like arms, face, neck, etc. You must apply it 15-20 minutes before going outdoors. It should be reapplied again after 2-3 hours. If the face becomes oily, it is a good idea to cleanse the face with a face wash and then reapply the sunblock.
My advice is to visit your dermatologist and take a skin biopsy to analyze the edges and the cell changes to clinch the perfect diagnosis. Biopsy is the definitive diagnosis.
Treatment option is adequate sun protection. You can use mid-potent steroid cream like Mometasone on the affected part every night for 12-14 days and you can see a dramatic improvement.
Avoid sun at all costs. Use a cloth to cover the area when you go outside. Strict sun protection is the cornerstone of the treatment. Try eating more of beta-carotene in diet from sources like carrots which act as natural sunscreens.

There are two well known methods to control pimples. One is by the use of oral antibiotics like Doxycycline or Minocycline or some other antibiotic.
The second one which is more rapid in action but needs to be practiced under strict supervision is the use of a class of compounds called retinoids. Both are for oral use.
The locally applied medicines including the one which you are using are to supplement the effects of the previously described oral medication. However, in milder or initial phase cases the local preparations themselves might be the only prescribed medication.
Acnemoist is supposed to be helping dryness that one encounters while on treatment with other medicines given for acne. As a standalone, it is not expected to help acne when given alone.
I would be more in favor of antibiotics for the control of acne as the first line of action. I am sure, now you know better as to how Acnemoist is going to help you.

Lichen planus is a chronic and self-limiting disease. It has been seen that skin lesions subside within  9-12 months in about 50 percent of the cases.
Since you are still developing fresh lesions you will have to take a course of tablet Prednisolone 20 mg daily for 6 weeks which can be reduced gradually.
You seem to have severe itching which is not responding much to Levocetirizine. I would recommend you take tablet Hydroxyzine 25 mg  twice daily till the itchy subsides.
Along with this apply Clobetasol propionate on the itchy areas. But if large surface area is involved, dilute it in a moisturizing lotion in the ratio of 1:4. This will surely help you.

First of all I would like you to thank for giving me a perfect clinical history with perfect photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
It is a crystal clear case of seborrheic dermatitis and is moderate in nature.
It is a fungal infection and is very chronic in nature. Like diabetes, it can only be controlled and cannot be cured permanently as the fungus causing it is a normal resident of skin. Whenever the condition becomes suitable for it, it proliferates.
The good news is that it is harmless. Diabetes can also cause severe seborrheic dermatitis,  because increased sugar gives fungus a suitable environment to proliferate.
As I said already that it is a chronic condition, follow up is very necessary. Currently, I will give you medicines for a month. Make sure to review your condition after a month as the dose and course would be decided accordingly.
Prescription is as follows:
Salisia KT Shampoo (Salicyclic Acid), twice weekly and keep it applied for 15 minutes for itchy scalp and dandruff.
Tablet Nizral (Ketoconazole) 200 mg once daily for 28 days.
Kz (Ketoconazole) cream, apply once in morning over affected part in face and body for itch and dryness.
Apply Pacroma (Pimecrolimus) 1% ointment in night over affected part.
Recommended investigations are liver function test and renal function test. Once these investigations came out to be normal you can safely start tablet Nizoral.

Hydrozole (combination of Hydrocortisone and Clotrimazole) cream contains steroid and should not be used as a treatment for jock itch (fungal infection of the groin). You will experience temporary relief while using it but your condition will aggravate once you stop using it. The redness in the groin is also because of the cream.
The rash you are experiencing on your hands is probably related to jock itch. In some individuals fungal infection leads to an allergic reaction on the hands. Once your fungal infection resolves this will also disappear.
I recommend you to apply plain antifungal cream on the groins and also take oral antifungal tablet for earlier resolution.

For severe dandruff, you should take oral medicines apart from topical treatment.
Consider taking tablet Ketoconazole 200 mg once daily for two weeks and apply Candid B lotion (Clotrimazole) on the affected scalp twice daily.
As far as shampoo is concerned, use shampoo containing Ketoconazole every alternate day to start with and then taper slowly as you feel improvement.

A person normally will lose 100 strands of hair daily. The problem of hair fall arises if the person loses more than 100 strands of hair which tends to make a visible scalp leading to androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness.
The main culprit is the DHT-dihydrotestosterone (the pivotal androgen in men) to which the hair is sensitive to, therefore DHT blockers will prevent hair fall.Investigations to be done:None required.Probable diagnosis:Androgenetic alopecia.Treatment plan:The treatment for hair loss has an individual variability, not all treatments will suit for all people and the treatment takes a minimum of 6 months for its full effect.

1. You can continue with Grocapix gel (Capixyl) and Capsule Logihair for now, since these treatments will take some amount of time to show the effect.

2. A new technique called platelet-rich plasma can be tried which should be taken in an interval of 2-3 weeks for 5-6 sittings.

I have read about your query and the history.
After an injury, anywhere for the matter may result in darkening termed as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Cicaplast makes the healing faster and since it is three months for now, the injury would have healed better.
A better healed scar has a little chance of getting more pigmented than a fresh one. You can now maintain it with just sunscreen which should be applied in the day time in a span of two to three hours.
Sunscreen protects your face from the UV (ultraviolet) rays and since your sunscreen has an SPF (sun protection factor) of 70, you will have a 98% protection from sun. So, just a sunscreen is enough.

I have read about your query. Your condition can be an acute urticaria/hives. It usually presents with itching.
Dermographism (dermatographism) is an exaggerated urticarial response which is also called as skin writing.
It is usually seen in young adults with a fair complexion and  it disappears in 6-8 hours.
It usually gets off course as the age progresses and it is just of a cosmetic concern.
Usually dermographism does not give any symptoms and usually has a trigger like stick injury, pressure, etc.
Investigations to be done:Complete blood count with differential count and IgE.Differential diagnosis:1. Acute urticaria.

2. Dermographism.Treatment plan:1. Antihistaminics like Fexofenadine, Levocetirizine.

2. A moisturizer can be applied.

I have gone through your complaint and have seen the attached photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
You are having herpes infection which is a viral infection.
You should take a course of antiviral like tablet Acyclovir 400 mg thrice in a day for 5 days and apply a topical antibiotic like Mupirocin on the affected area twice daily. This will resolve the lesion within 4-5 days.
This disease has a tendency to recur as the virus lies in the nerves of the host. Stress, ultraviolet radiation, surgery and infections can cause recurrence of the infection.

					Thanks for your answer doctor. But from where would I get herpes from? And which type of herpes is this? I am not married nor did I have any sexual contact so far. What is the cure for this? I have never had this thing in my life. I am not sure but at least as far as I can remember.

						  Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Herpes labialis is usually caused by type 1 Herpes simplex virus and sometimes by type 2 Herpes simplex virus. 
It has been seen that primary infection occurs in the majority of cases in early childhood before the age of 5 years and is usually mild. May be it had gone unnoticed in your case.
There is no permanent cure of the disease as the virus resides in the nerves.
For confirmation of the infection, you have to undergo a blood test IgG and IgM for HSV 1 and HSV 2.
Wish you speedy recovery.

I have gone through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
This is mostly a wart.
Melanoma are generally black in color.
Melanoma are very rarely seen in young age.
This lesion of hers has mostly no feature of melanoma.
Wart occurs due to one of these reasons say pricking, thorn or from other person if the virus gets into your skin. The virus stays there and slowly grows.
Also wart is infectious i.e, after touching a wart if you touch anywhere else you can get a wart there too.
So the most important advice is "do not touch at all".
Wart has to be removed as early as possible before it spreads much.
It can be removed by radio frequency cautery which burns the wart and is removed.
Many creams and acids are also there to use but I consider cautery as the first line of treatment, as chances of recurrence are less with it and the wart is removed in one sitting.
I advice her to get it removed by cautery as early as possible.

I have seen the attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Since there are many causes of nodule and complete history with good clinical examination is necessary to diagnose the nodule, I would like to give a differential diagnosis of what could it be.
Although it is looking more like a dermatofibroma, other possibilities are sebaceous cyst, pilomatrixoma, calcinosis cutis, folliculoma and dermoid cyst.
However almost all these conditions are benign and simple surgical excision is the treatment of choice.
I would suggest you to visit a local dermatologist so that he could palpate the lesion and can reach the diagnosis.

It is a case of papular urticaria, a type of insect hypersensitivity reaction with irritant dermatitis.
It is a very common problem and harmless too.
It has nothing to do with Flonase (Fluticasone propionate). So, if you are using it for any other indication you can safely go for it.
Just apply Mupirocin ointment twice daily.
The spots will completely subside in 1 week.
Please let me know if any new lesions are continuously appearing, as in that case you may need oral medication.

As per the details given, it seems that you have hair dye allergy.
Most of the hair dye products contain a chemical called PPD (para phenylenediamine) which is responsible for allergic reactions. 
In such cases, I advice my patients to strictly avoid application of hair dye.
You may use herbal henna for dyeing hair.
I advice my patients to apply topical steroid like hydrocortisone on the affected area. 
Antihistaminics like Levocetirizine also help. 
You need clinical examination. So, you should visit your doctor so that he can examine you and give you prescription accordingly. You can share my opinion with him. 
Stay healthy.

What you have mentioned as scrotal dermatitis can be lichen simplex chronicus (causing chronic itching and scratching).
Since it is a relapsing disorder, it is very difficult to get control over the disease.
It's etiology is not clear.
Nutritional factors, stress and environmental factors do contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.
There is no need of any test, though patch test can be done if some sort of allergy is suspected.
Your doctor would have told you about the relapsing nature of this disease.
It is not an infection which can be cured, it is more like a hypertension which can only be controlled.
Take care.

There are two probabilities of your condition, one is allergic contact dermatitis and the other is pompholyx which is also known as dyshidrotic eczema. 
Since you have not mentioned your age, complaint,  onset and progression of these bumps in details, I am unable to comment anything with a solid base.
Meanwhile use Clobetasol cream twice daily for 20 days (strictly 20 days) and review after that.

I have gone through your query and attachments. (attachment removed to protect patient identity)
It is not looking like fungal infection.
It is more in favour of urticaria.
Does it remain the same or fades with time and recur again?
Does it aggravate with physical exercise or sun exposure? 
Are you on any medications?
As for now, take tablet Allegra180mg once daily and tablet Teczine M once daily at night.

Coming to the differential diagnosis and treatment:
Chances of it being furuncle is less as it is a progressive condition and would have certainly popped out by pressing.
Carbuncle is the collection of  furuncle, so chances of  it again is very less.
Since you have a history of molluscum, it could be molluscum, but you have  destroyed its classical morphology by popping it out in early stage.
It can certainly be an infected sebaceous cyst or infected apocrine gland which are normally present in high number over the genital area.
You were right of it not being any STD.
Lymphadenopathy is a non specific finding and could be due to any infection involving the genitalia.
Take Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid 625mg twice daily for 7 days.
Continue betadine lotion and do not try to pop it out.

Thanks for sending such an excellent description of your medical history and reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity)
I would like to say that both the dermatologists have recommended the best as per available literature in medical science, which clearly indicates that there is almost negligible interaction between Cyclosporine and Finasteride.
Increase in uric acid seen in your reports is due to Cyclosporine which is a known agent for causing hyperuricemia.
You can safely start Finasteride 1mg per day.
Do not use Saw Palmetto as there are no studies regarding their efficacy and of course their interaction with Cyclosporine.
I would recommend the use of topical Finasteride,  as there are growing evidences of similar efficacy as that of oral one.
Although not approved till now, it definitely does not have any systemic side effects of oral Finasteride and thereby  interactions too.
It is avaliable in the brand name of  MORR-F (5% Minoxidil + Finasteride), so perfect in your case.

Moderately severe to severe grade of acne and persisting since years such as in your case is an automatic choice for treatment with Oral Retinoids i.e Isotretinoin. 
You may continue with other topical medications like Adapalene+ Clindamycin and Benzoyl peroxide gel and oral antibiotics such as Azithromycin.

Thank you for providing all the details.
I shall answer your questions one by one.
1. As you have mentioned that you do not have any symptoms at the moment, there is no need to take Acyclovir. 2. A repeat test can be done just for your reassurance. Chances of false positive result is there with every test due to technical errors. 3. HSV-1 is primarily not transmitted through sexual intercourse, but kissing or oral sex can cause transmission to partners. 4. Except encephalitis, HSV-1 causes no life threatening diseases. 5. A positive IgG means exposure to the virus anytime during your entire life. IgM shows present infection. You might have had a sub-clinical infection earlier, which is very common. 6. The herbs do not work and there is no data to support this. Hope this relieves your anxiety. Take care.

This might be allergic contact dermatitis or cosmetic induced acne.
Make sure that you do not get exposed to that chemical within the next 10 days otherwise there are chances of sensitization and can cause further flare up of the disease.
Apply the following medicines on the affected areas:
Dermitop cream twice daily in a small amount for 10 days.
Use KZ cream once daily for 15 days.
As of now, I am not prescribing any oral medication, but it might be needed if the response to topical application is poor.Revert back to a dermatologist online for review after 10 days --&gt;

I have seen the white patches of your baby in the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
This is not vitiligo, because
1. Vitiligo will be depigmented and not hypopigmented as in your case.
2. Vitiligo is very rare in infancy.
3. Vitiligo is almost always progressive before coming to a stable phase (in most cases). So, it can be nevus achromicus or nevus depigmentosus.
To differentiate between the two conditions, clinical examination and Woods light examination is required.

You are suffering from either scabies or urticaria.
Since no other skin lesion is present this is going more in favour of scabies.
Does any of your other colleagues suffering from itching?
Does itching occur predominantly at night?

1) Calosoft lotion - to be applied on the body twice daily.
2) Tablet Teczine 5mg - to be taken twice daily.
3) HH Mite soap - for bathing.

Isotretinoin is a potentially dangerous drug and in many countries there are very strict guidelines over its use. It basically contains retinoids which in simple language is a derivative of vitamin A. It is primarily used to treat severe cystic acne and I fail to understand why your doctor has prescribed it to you for psoriasis.
Its side effects include:
Dry lips/dry and fragile skin/incresed risk of sun burns.
Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
Decreased night vision and dry eyes.
Anemia and decreased platelets in blood.
Diabetes and increased uric acid level in blood.
Depression/anxiety/mood disturbances.
Nose bleeding/headaches.
Joint and body pains.
Loss of hair i.e, alopecia.
Increased cholesterol.
Well, I need some more information:
1) For how long have you been suffering from scalp psoriasis?
2) Exact name and exact dose of the medicines which you are taking?
3) For how long have you been taking each medicine (in detail)?
4) Any medicine which you had taken in the past but not taking now?
5) Do you feel any side effects which I have mentioned above?
6) How much relief have you got in your scalp psoriasis from these medicines or no effect at all yet?
7) Do you have psoriatic lesions anywhere else on the body or just on scalp?
Kindly provide these information, so that we can evaluate your case in detail and prescribe you with the best possible treatment.

Stop using all the creams or cosmetics for time being.
Wipe the affected area with saline water 2-3 times a day initially.

I understand your worry. 
I think you need to follow your doctor's advice (get the nail removed surgically) as it seems that the nail is detached from its bed.
But get the procedure done only by a surgeon or a dermatologist.
And get it done as soon as possible because, the earlier you get it done, the more the chances are that your nail will grow back before April.
If the nail has not grown back completely before April, do a good sterile dressing during camping. 
Hope this helps.
Take care.

Water has no effect on graying of hair though hard water can cause dryness of hair. 
If your parents also had premature graying of hair then yours is hereditary (genetically inherited). 
You can start tablet PABA 100mg once a day for 2 months. 
This will prevent further greying of hair. Take care.

Psoriasis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder.
What you have heard about lack of Vitamin D as its cause is a myth among patients because now a days there is a new class of topical drugs available which are analogues of Vitamin D.
These reduce the excessive cell proliferation and differentiation seen in the skin cells of a psoriasis patient.
A few of these drugs are calcipotriol,calcitriol, tacalcitol.
Their pros are that they do not cause skin atrophy but they are useful only for stable moderate psoriasis.
To help you better I need photographs plus a detailed history with previous medication you had taken.

Before I can help you, please tell me the average number of hairs that fall for you in a day?
Are you taking any sort of medications? Have you fallen sick in the past one year? Does your father or paternal uncles have baldness? Do you have dandruff?
You can start with biotin 10 mg orally and minoxidil 5 % topically. 
But to be sure it is male pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia, I will need the details I have mentioned above.

1) Corticosteroids should never be applied without a doctor's advise.
2) Also there are certain steroids which should never be applied on the face.
If you could send me photos and details, I  will  be able to write a proper prescription for you. Till then do not use anything on your own, it does more harm than good.

You may continue the use of kojivit gel which is based on kojic acid.
However I would rather recommend you to replace kojivit gel with Vitamin-C based  creams.
The soap you have mentioned is fine, but make sure you are following a good facial routine which means cleansing, toning and moisturizing.
Also I hope the soap you are using does not make your skin over dry, as this could be one of the reasons for dullness.
I would better recommend a face wash which is more gentle and hygienic than a soap.
You may try cetaphil face wash and moisturizer depending upon your skin type and you can also tone your skin with rose water sprays regularly.
As per a recent research, Vitamin-K based creams work much better for skin moisturising along with improving the blood supply, regenerating the broken  capillaries which are responsible for dullness over a period of time.
